Health Care policy will play a pivotal role in the 2020 elections. What do voters need to know to make an intelligent choice in the March 3 primary? Don’t miss this opportunity to hear experts present, compare and contrast the health care policy options favored by the presidential candidates, 10 days before the primary. Speakers will present and field questions. Laurel Lucia will outline all of the leading candidates’ plans. Shruthi and Swathi Bhuma will focus on single-payer plans. Speakers will enlighten our intelligent East Bay audience without advocating any particular candidate or policy.

Sponsor:  Health Care Team of Indivisible Berkeley

Speakers: Laurel Lucia, Director of Health Care Program, UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education; Shruthi and Swathi Bhuma, Board Members, California Physicians Alliance
