We can't canvass in Tracy this year, but we can still help out our friends at the Tracy Dems as they support Josh Harder and other down-ballot candidates.  On  Saturdays and Sundays **Oct 3rd, 4th, 10th, and 11th,** the Tracy Dems will be organizing lit drops with no contact.  We'll meet in a local park to pick up the material and use the PDI app.  Drive your own car and bring a member of your pod to help out!
