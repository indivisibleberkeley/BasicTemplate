Join the Tracy Dems on Oct. 3,4,10, and 11 to safely drop lit. We can't canvass in Tracy this year, but we can still help out our friends at the Tracy Dems as they support Josh Harder and other down-ballot candidates.  On  Saturdays and Sundays **Oct 3rd, 4th, 10th, and 11th,** the Tracy Dems will be organizing lit drops with no contact.  We'll meet in a local park to pick up the material and use the PDI app.  Drive your own car and bring a member of your bubble to help out!
