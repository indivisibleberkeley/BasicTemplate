We'll be calling for Josh Harder, a strong, progressive candidate for Congress in a very tight race in neighboring CD-10 (Tracy, Modesto). Republicans are pouring money into this district to keep this seat -- so we need all hands on deck!

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details.
