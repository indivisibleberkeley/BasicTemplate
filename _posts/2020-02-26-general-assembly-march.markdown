How to call in to the IB March General Assembly

We have 2 options for connecting to the General Assembly. They will both connect you to the same line — it’s just a matter of whether you prefer to call in on your phone or on your computer.

By computer (video chat, almost as good as being there):

    Visit [https://zoom.us/j/363988688](https://zoom.us/j/363988688) - that link goes directly to the meeting
    You may be asked to download and install the Zoom software; we encourage you to do so! Once it’s downloaded you’ll be able to get right in the meeting. 

By phone (conference call, reliable backup if video is not an option):

    Dial (669) 900-9128 on your landline or cell phone
    When asked for a “Meeting ID,” enter 363 988 688 followed by # (pound)
    When asked for a “Participant ID,” simply dial # (pound)
