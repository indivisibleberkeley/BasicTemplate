**Help Spanish-speaking Arizonans exercise their right to vote!**

Speak Spanish fluently? Join Spanish language phone banks to help turn out Arizona voters so we can win this hard-fought race  in a critical swing state! Help flip the White House, a Senate seat, and help Democrats down ballot! These events are led by local Arizona Latinx organizers . You'll have your choice of calling using the automated dialer, which has a higher contact rate and also masks your personal phone number, or you can opt for using OpenVPB.
