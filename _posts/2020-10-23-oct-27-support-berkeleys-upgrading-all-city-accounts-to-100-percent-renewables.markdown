Dear Climate Leaders,

District 4 Berkeley City Council Member Kate Harrison is inviting the public to join the Council meeting on Tuesday October 27, where they will be voting on her proposed legislation to upgrade Berkeley municipal electricity accounts to 100% renewable energy.  The announcement from Council Member Harrison is below:

On Tuesday, October 27, sometime after 6 pm, the City Council will be voting on my legislation upgrading all City of Berkeley municipal electricity accounts to 100% renewable energy. If we pass this item and fund it, our City will soon run entirely on wind and solar power. Doing so will support California’s burgeoning solar and wind energy sector with the potential to help further offset electricity generated from natural gas and nuclear. Please call into the meeting or send an email in support of Item 25!
