We're calling voters, supporting Josh Harder for Congress -- a strong, progressive candidate in an agonizingly tight race against the incumbent in neighboring CD-10 (Tracy, Modesto).

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

WHERE:  Finnish Hall upstairs meeting room

RSVP soon!
