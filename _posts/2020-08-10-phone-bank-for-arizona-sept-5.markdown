## Help flip this swing state!

Arizona is a key battleground state– for the Presidency and the Senate.  We’ll be calling voters to help them apply for mail-in ballots SOON, so they get them in time to vote safely and actually have it count!  We’ll be calling with the Arizona Democratic Party’s coordinated campaign, “Mission for Arizona,” supporting Senate candidate Mark Kelly and Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.

We’ll be using Zoom videoconferencing software for this virtual event.  We’ll do a quick group training together, and trainers will be available to answer questions. You can also ask for help or comment to the group as you’re making your calls!

Please RSVP as soon as possible, so that we can send you the log-in and info you’ll want to read, and we can answer questions or offer tech support by phone before the event.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: a charged iPad, tablet, or computer; and your cell phone (or landline).
