We will be joining a Swing Left -organized event for the weekend of Mar. 28-29.

We'll be registering voters, asking voters to sign up for absentee voting, canvassing for state elections, and recruiting volunteers. Some supporter housing may be available.

IBers will sign up through Swing Left, but our point person for this trip is Canvassing Captain Lynn Mueller, lmueller510@gmail.com, who is available now for your questions.

This is high season in AZ so the trip is filling up fast! (Also note there are trips the previous weekend, and mid-week, for those who want to stay longer.)
