Work hard up to and including election day for the Virginia legislative elections and voter registration efforts.

Then join your pals from Indivisible Berkeley, East Bay Activist Alliance, East Bay Young Democrats, Indivisible East Bay, Resistance Action East Bay, SwingLeft East Bay, Together We Will Albany-Berkeley and Wellstone Democratic Renewal Club to watch the results. 

Drop in anytime after 5:30pm or when you are finished phone banking, text banking, or biting your nails alone.
