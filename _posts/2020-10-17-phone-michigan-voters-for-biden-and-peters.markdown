Michigan is a key battleground state â€“ for the presidency, the Senate, the House, state legislature, EVERYTHING. We need your help to flip Republican-held seats blue and re-elect Democrats at every level in Michigan.

Join the Michigan Democratic Party's coordinated campaign to call voters in support of Joe Biden for President and Gary Peters for Senate! They are hosting virtual phone banks all-day until Election Day. The exact time varies by day, but roughly the shifts last from 7:00am-5:00pm Pacific Time. The campaign uses a software called ThruTalk, but if you're not familiar with it, don't worry! Each of the phone bank shifts will kick off with a quick training to make sure you know everything necessary, and the events are staffed with trainers to help you. These events are organized by the party (not by IB), but we encourage you to join them.

Full details are at the links below, including how to RSVP!
