Doors open at 7. We start promptly at 7:30.

Join us for this interactive Bystander Intervention Training! This training will be led by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. During the training, participants will learn about the history and principles of nonviolence, and will practice specific de-escalation techniques as a bystander in a variety of scenarios. 

Questions? Email [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

ADA Accessibility: The Finnish Hall has stairs leading up to the entrance so is not ADA accessible. Please email us at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with questions.
