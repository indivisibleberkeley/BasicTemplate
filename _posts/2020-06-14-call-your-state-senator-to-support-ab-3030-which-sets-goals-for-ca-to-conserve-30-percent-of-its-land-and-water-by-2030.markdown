ACTION: Call your State Senator to support AB 3030 which sets goals for California to conserve 30% of its land and water by 2030 to help California combat climate change and preserve biodiversity. Thank your Assembly person if they voted for AB 3030.

CALL by June 24th:

Senator Nancy Skinner - (916) 651-4009\
Assemblymember: Buffy Wicks - (916) 319-2015 (voted for bill)

If outside this area, you can find your representatives at [http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/](http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/)

AB 3030 calls for “improving access to nature for all people in the state, with a specific emphasis on increasing access for communities of color and economically disadvantaged communities”. The goals set by this bill should propel the state to finance more conservation jobs in the state. Many of these are outdoor jobs that could provide training and work opportunities for minorities. Conserving more land and water areas will also help buffer communities against the disastrous storms and wildfires that await us in the future. Many of these high risk communities are communities of color.

***Suggested Scrip*****t (shorten as you wish and personalize as in paragraph 2):**

Please work to get AB 3030 passed in the Senate. Its goal of protecting 30% of California’s land and waters by 2030 will make us more resilient to the climate change that we can expect in the future and help keep the IPPC’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C a possibility*.*

I am very concerned about the effects of climate change and the need to preserve biodiversity throughout the world and in California. I am an avid (.....e.g. hiker, birder, biker, sailor, nature lover) and appreciate California’s many wonderful natural resources.

Scientists have warned us that nature like climate is reaching a tipping point. They have also indicated that two of the most cost effective ways of fighting climate change are the conservation and restoration of nature. California has already protected 22% of its land and 16% of its water so the goal is definitely within reach.

**BACKGROUND**

Scientists have repeatedly warned that the world needs to rapidly reduce the conversion of natural land to agriculture and infrastructure (much of it road building) if it is to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. They further warn that land conversions and greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by 2030 to attain this 1.5° limit. Confining the expansion of agriculture to degraded lands and restoring other degraded areas to natural areas is becoming more important every year.

Ecologists like E. O. Wilson have called for a moratorium on the conversion of natural land to other uses by 2035. They are calling for the protection of 50% of all land by 2050.

Of the Paris Agreement signatories 65% have committed to restoring and conserving their ecosystems to reduce global warming.

Two thirds of all species on Earth are found in natural forests. These ecosystems clean our water and air, cool our earth, stabilize our climate and provide valued recreation for many people. Intact forests (especially tropical and tundra) sequester twice the carbon that planted monocultures do. Along the coasts the least disturbed wetlands and coastal habitats have shown superior ability in storing carbon.

Over one million acres of natural areas were lost in California from 2001-2017.

AB3030 calls for working with the federal government, local communities, Indian tribes and private landowners to conserve resources under their control. Working with the federal government is key because it owns 48% of the land in California. Indian tribes have a long history of being responsible stewards of land and water and this bill will help them get recognition for their stewardship.

US Senators M. Bennett and T. Udall introduced a 30 by 30 Resolution to Save Nature bill in the US Senate in October 2019. It is cosponsored by K. Harris, C. Booker, J. Merkley, D. Durbin and R. Blumenthal. Hawaii has introduced a 30 by 30 bill as well. Only South Carolina has adopted 30 by 30 legislation so far. Many environmental organizations support this bill including the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, the National Wildlife Federation and Green Latinos.

The California Conservation Corps trains young people (many minority) for forestry restoration and maintenance, rebuilding and maintaining wetlands, fire protection and emergency response to natural disasters. It offers a monthly stipend of about $2000 per month. If AB 3030 passes into law these types of training opportunities should increase as well as other jobs for minorities.
