Help Fight Voter Suppression!

That's what we'll be doing with our friends at \*East Bay Activist Alliance, \*and \*Reclaim Our Vote, a coalition of civil rights and voting rights groups. We'll be calling to help register people of color who live in key battleground states, but are discouraged from voting by state restrictions and barriers. Help empower citizens to participate in elections that affect their lives.

If you're new to phone banking, we'll help you get comfortable calling voters!

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you. If you can, be green and bring your own water bottle! We'll provide snacks.
