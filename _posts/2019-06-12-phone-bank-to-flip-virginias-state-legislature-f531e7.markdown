Indivisible Berkeley is supporting the Center for Common Ground's Voter Project by calling voters of color to encourage them to vote in North Carolina's special congressional election on September 10.  Early voting starts this month! If North Carolina hasn't published its polling places in time for this phone bank, we'll be working to register citizens who have been dropped from the voter rolls.

Background: Dan McCready, Democrat is running, this time against Republican Dan Bishop.  The district is currently unrepresented due to electoral fraud by the Republican campaign in 2018. 

Registration ends September 3rd. Help us get voters out!
