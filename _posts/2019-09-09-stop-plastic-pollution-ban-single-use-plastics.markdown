**Help us pass AB 1080 and SB 54 to ensure California bans single use plastic.**  

SB 54 and AB 1080 are companion bills requiring manufacturers and retailers in California to reduce single-use plastic packaging and products by 75 percent by 2030. After 2030, all single-use plastics sold in the state would need to be compostable or recyclable.The American Plastics Manufacturers are lobbying hard to defeat these bills. They are calling legislators right now saying the state does not have the capacity to deal with recycling all of our plastics and that these bills will make things worse.  

Banning single use plastics is a critical step to a zero-emissions, zero-waste economy.  
* Plastics are made from fossil fuel, especially cheap by-products of fracking. The petrochemical industry is looking to expand, creating more plastic products.  
* China and other Asian countries are no longer accepting our cheap plastics for recycling so plastic recycling is not an option.  
* Plastics are filling up our landfills and creating methane.  
* Plastics are killing ocean life.  
* Micro-plastics are showing everywhere in the environment, including in the arctic snows.  

This is a priority climate bill as the California Legislature session comes to an end September 13.  Every Senate and Assembly member needs to hear from us before they vote in the next week. We need YOU to help push this critical bill over the finish line!
