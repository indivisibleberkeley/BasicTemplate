Please join the Science and Environment Team to support the Bay Area Youth Led Climate Strike on Friday Sept. 20th in San Francisco. Young people are stepping up to make our politicians, corporations and general public take notice and act NOW on THE issue of our time -- the Climate Crisis.  It is imperative that we support the rising generation at this critical moment!

The march starts at the Federal Building 90 7th Street (Pelosi's office), San Francisco, at 10 am and will proceed down Market Street to the Embarcadero, with stops and events along the way at Amazon (where 1000 workers are joining the strike!), ICE headquarters,  Bank of America, and PG&E. 

We will meet at North Berkeley BART at 9 a.m. and convene at 9:50 in front of the Grove Street entrance of the main SF Library (across the street from Civic Center BART exit).  We plan to have the IB banner with us but look for IB shirts if no banner.

(There will also be an action at Sproul Plaza, UC Berkeley, at 11 am and in the inner quad of Laney College in Oakland at 10 am.)
