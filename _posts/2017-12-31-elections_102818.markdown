# This meeting is CANCELLED due to [GOTV for the election](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/update/gotv)

The Elections Team focuses on flipping red districts through voter contact. We canvass, phonebank, write postcards, and register new voters. We work with and support local partners.

We also work on electoral reform issues.

Come hang out with us at our monthly meeting!
