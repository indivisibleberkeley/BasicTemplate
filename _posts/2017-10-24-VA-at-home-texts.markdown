You can send texts from the comfort of your own home, on your own time (but not while it’s too late on the east coast!) Sign up to textbank at [this link](https://www.sisterdistrict.com/programs/textbanking) (password is gameonva - but please keep this password confidential). Once you sign in, there are step-by-step instructions for downloading the program and using it effectively. [Here's the how-to link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mucy_iFAL43jXCVjE9pkhPsU54P3TDJCSJDBF4EwCsI/edit#slide=id.g277f18b084_0_199). You can also join a Slack group at [this link](https://sisterdistrict.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2FC7ENFBY3D) to get timely feedback and answers to your questions. Here’s a handy handbook with more information about what you’ll be doing. If you have questions, feel free to email Penni Takade (pennitakade@gmail.com) or Steve Cohen (cohensteve@att.net).
