Join the Josh Harder Campaign for a Virtual Day of Action - Saturday, August 1st!

In 2018 we successfully helped get Josh Harder elected to the House of Representatives, representing Congressional District CA-10 (Tracy/Modesto). Now, he's running another competitive campaign for re-election, and he needs our help to win! Join the campaign for it's first-ever virtual day of action to textbank for Josh using OutVote. A full training will be provided and then you'll be texting low turnout voters, asking them to support Josh. And, you might even get to hear from Josh himself!

[Sign up](https://www.mobilize.us/harderforcongress/event/291073/) for one or both texting shifts:

* Saturday, August 1st: 10 am - 12 pm

* Saturday, August 1st: 2 pm - 4 pm

You can find out more information and RSVP on the [Mobilize event page](https://www.mobilize.us/harderforcongress/event/291073/).
