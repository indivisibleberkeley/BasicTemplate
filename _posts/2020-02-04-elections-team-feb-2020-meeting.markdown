The Elections Team focuses on flipping red districts and holding on to blue districts through voter contact. We canvass, phonebank, write postcards, and register new voters. We work with and support local partners.

We also work on electoral reform issues.

Come hang out with us at our monthly meeting!

Potluck at 6:30pm, meeting begins at 6:45.
