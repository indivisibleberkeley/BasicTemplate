Join Indivisible Berkeley in phoning Virginia voters -- this is a "last chance" election before redistricting.  We're supporting 3 campaigns: Cheryl Turpin for VA Senate District 7; Alex Askew and Nancy Guy for House of Delegates.

WHY VIRGINIA?  In 2017, 1 vote decided control of the Virginia House of Delegates. Virginia State legislators elected in 2019  will draw up  Virginiaâ€™s US congressional district map and affect national elections.  Each vote really matters!

Republicans spent decades working to control state legislatures and gerrymandering to create their majorities.  We can't cede state level races to them.
