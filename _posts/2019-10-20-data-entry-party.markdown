Want to lend a hand in bringing IB’s database up to speed? We’re planning a data entry party to double-check and cross-reference volunteer sign-in sheets. **New folks - this is a fun and easy way to get started with IB!** We'll have time to grab dinner across the street at La Mission, too. RSVP requested - email info@indivisibleberkeley.org.

Location: Finnish Hall Cafe (downstairs, come to side entrance)
