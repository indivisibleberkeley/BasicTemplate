If you have NOT texted before or if you need more practice with texting skills, please email us at EBAATexting@gmail.com to arrange for a one-on-one texting session preceding this party. At your one-on-one session, we will be able to guide you through the steps of getting started so you are prepared to text with us on Saturday, July 25, during which we will have less capacity to provide training.

We'll send out a complete briefing email 24-72 hours in advance with ALL of the information you'll need to prepare for and attend this texting party! Please look for an email from EBAATexting@gmail.com with that information.
