### Help fight voter suppression!

Join us -- we'll be calling voters of color in underserved communities in Georgia to urge them to vote in the upcoming Primary in June  -- an important one as both US Senate seats are on the ballot this year!

Early voting starts soon for the June 9 primary, and the state is now allowing absentee balloting, so we want to get that information to voters as well. They need to send in requests to obtain absentee ballots as early as possible.

VIRTUAL PHONE BANKING: IB is offering virtual activities only for awhile as we monitor the coronavirus situation. But our work is needed as much as ever, and it’s a lot more fun if we can work together during this difficult period. 

We’ll be using Zoom videoconferencing software for this event . We’ll do a quick group training together, and trainers will be available to answer questions. You can also ask for help or comment to the group as you’re making your calls.

Please RSVP as soon as possible.  

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or computer and your cell phone (or landline).
