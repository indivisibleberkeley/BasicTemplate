Alameda County Sheriff Greg Ahern is a conservative Republican and wildly out of touch with his constituents.
* While Berkeley and other Alameda County cities have taken steps to limit cooperation with ICE, Ahern welcomes ICE into the jails and is [actively turning people over to ICE](http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2017/02/21/advocates-criticize-alameda-sheriffs-cooperation-with-immigration-enforcement) for detention and deportation.
* As a member of the California State Sheriffs’ Association, Sheriff Ahern has consistently lobbied [against criminal justice reforms](http://anewscafe.com/2014/10/24/sheriffs-of-california-oppose-prop-47/) that would move away from incarceration and towards community-based programs, despite these reforms receiving overwhelming support from Alameda County voters.
* Sheriff Ahern proudly hosts [Urban Shield](https://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2017/09/08/alameda-county-sheriff-hosts-11th-urban-shield-training-for-emergency-responders-and-swat-teams), a program which gives police access to battlefield weapons and military-style training.
* Sheriff Ahern has allied himself with the Trump Administration, publicly [endorsing Jeff Sessions for Attorney General](http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2017/03/20/critics-call-alameda-sheriff-gregory-aherns-support-of-trump-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-a-disgrace).

Ahern has been reelected three times and has run unopposed all three times - we need 2018 to be different! An effort is underway to get a more progressive candidate in the race.
