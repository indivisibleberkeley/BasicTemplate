Some of you wrote postcards to low-propensity voters in CD 10 to help the Josh Harder campaign.  They have asked us if we would write another round of postcards.  I have 500 names that I would like to distribute (we can get more) and they will be mailed from Modesto at the end of September.  If you would like to help re-elect Josh Harder by writing postcards, contact:  RobertaCBrooks@gmail.com
