Michigan is a key battleground state. We need your help! Join us – we’ll be calling Michigan voters with the state Democratic Party’s coordinated campaign, the “ONE Campaign for Michigan,” supporting Presidential nominee Joe Biden, incumbent Senator Gary Peters (who’s in a tight race), and Democratic candidates up and down the ballot!

If you are new to phone banking or to Zoom, we are here to help. We’ll do online training together, and Trainers will be available throughout to answer questions. You’ll be able to request help in a private conversation at any time during the phone bank.

What you’ll need: A charged ipad, tablet, or computer and your cell phone or landline.

Please RSVP to participate so we can email you instructions for joining the event. If you are not currently an IB member, we encourage you to join when you sign up so we can keep you posted about upcoming IB events.  (No dues, no obligations)

Any questions? Contact us at phonebank+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org

Looking forward to seeing you at the phone bank
