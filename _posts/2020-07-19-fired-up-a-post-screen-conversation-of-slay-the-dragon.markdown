**Fired Up! A Post-Screen Conversation of Slay the Dragon**

Fire it up for our fall campaign by joining East Bay Activist Alliance, fellow activists and friends for a lively discussion inspired by Slay The Dragon, the powerful new documentary about the successful grassroots campaign to end partisan gerrymandering in Michigan and beyond. We’ll be joined by [**Jamie Lyons Edie**](https://votersnotpoliticians.com/about/team/jamie-lyons-eddy/) **from Voters Not Politicians (VNP),** the organization which led the 2018 ballot initiative Redistricting Reform Amendment, as well as Michigan candidates — all of whom support VNP’s VoteSafe campaign to protect our elections during the pandemic. **Note:** This is not a film screening. Slay the Dragon can be viewed for $4.99 through several [streaming services.](https://www.slaythedragonfilm.com/watch-at-home/) Though recommended, seeing the film is not a prerequisite for our conversation about the strengths of grassroots activism toward a representative democracy in the wake of a brazen, systematic power grab.

“The most important political film of the year, and it may prove to be one of the key political films of the decade.” – Variety
