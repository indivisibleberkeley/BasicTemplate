Help people exercise their right to vote in 2020!

Working with *Reclaim Our Vote*, a coalition of voting rights and civil rights organizations,  we'll be calling citizens in key battleground states to help them register to vote.  People of color, our target population, often face unfair barriers to voting -- let's help them exercise their right to participate in elections that affect their lives.

New to phone banking? We'll help get you comfortable calling voters!

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you. If you can, be green and bring your own water bottle! We'll provide snacks.
