Phone Michigan voters to help re-elect Laurie Pohutsky to the Michigan State House! Laurie won by a razor-thin margin in 2018 (221 votes, 1/2 of a percent), and needs our support to keep her seat. We can flip the state legislature this year with only a few wins -- so defending Laurie's seat is critical, and calling for her also helps Democratic candidates up and down the ballot in her district!

We'll be working together on zoom, and we'll offer training and support throughout the event.

**Please RSVP** as soon as possible, but we strongly recommend 1/2 hour before our start time at the latest – or we may miss you! Earlier is better, so that we can send you info you’ll want to read, and  answer questions or offer tech support. by phone before the event.

If you are not currently an IB member, we encourage you to click and join when you sign up so we can keep you posted about upcoming IB events!

**What You’ll Need**: A computer, ipad or tablet, and your cell phone or landline.
