Make calls for Joe! Start any time!
We'll help you get set up at home, and then you can either set your own schedule or join Virtual meetings with support.
We're meeting Virtually on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons 1-4 to phone with a group, on dates that are planned to not conflict with  Indivisible Berkeley phone banks for our down ballot and coordinated targets. Upcoming dates and states are Sat 5/30 AZ, Wed 6/3 MI, Sat 6/13 AZ, Wed 6/17 MI, and Wed 6/24 MI. Contact Cheryl Fippen for more info about how to get started!  clfippen@mail.com
