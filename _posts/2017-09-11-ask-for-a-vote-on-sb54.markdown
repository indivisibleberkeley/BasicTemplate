  Call Speaker Rendon's office: **916-319-2063**

  Hello, my name is _______ and I am calling to ask Assembly Speaker Rendon to put SB 54, the California Values Act, up for a vote immediately. California must lead and protect our immigrant communities against increasing attacks from Trump’s deportation machine, whether it’s the pardon of racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio or canceling DACA. Can we count with Speaker Rendon's leadership on SB 54?

As of Monday, Sept. 11, Governor Brown and Senate President Pro Tem de León have reached an agreement on SB54, the California Values Act. SB54 prevents state and local law enforcement resources from being diverted to enforce any federal immigration crackdown. [The bill was amended today](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/11/last-minute-changes-narrow-california-sanctuary-state-immigration-bill/) and is no longer as strong as it was when first introduced, but it still provides a critical layer of protection for undocumented immigrants in California.

Assembly Speaker Rendon has the power to bring up the bill for a vote as soon as it passes the mandatory waiting period following today's amendments. This is the last week of the legislative session - **the bill must pass by Friday!** Please take a moment to call Speaker Rendon's office (916-319-2063) and demand that he bring the bill up for a vote as soon as possible!
