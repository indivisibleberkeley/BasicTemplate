### Help people exercise their right to vote in 2020!

People of color in some key 2020 wing states face discouraging barriers to voting. Working with our friends at *East Bay Activist Alliance* and *Reclaim Our Vote*, a coalition of voting and civil rights organizations, we'll be calling citizens in these battleground states to help them exercise their right to participate in elections that affect their lives.

WHAT YOU"LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you. If you can, be green and bring your own water bottle! We'll provide snacks.
