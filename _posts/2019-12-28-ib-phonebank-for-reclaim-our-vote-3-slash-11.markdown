### Call voters in Arizona and help them exercise their right to vote in 2020! 

People of color in Arizona, a key state in 2020 races for the Senate and White House, face barriers to voting. Working with Reclaim Our Vote, a coalition of voting rights and civil rights organizations, we'll be calling Arizona citizens to help them exercise their right to vote.

WHAT YOU"LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you. If you can, be green and bring your own water bottle! We'll provide snacks.
