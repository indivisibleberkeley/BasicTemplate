### Help people exercise their right to vote in 2020!

Working with our friends at *East Bay Activist Alliance*, we'll be calling citizens in key battleground states to help them exercise their right to participate in elections that affect their lives.

WHAT YOU"LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you. If you can, be green and bring your own water bottle! We'll provide snacks.
