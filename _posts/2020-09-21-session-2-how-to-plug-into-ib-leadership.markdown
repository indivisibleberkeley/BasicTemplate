We see the need for fresh voices and ideas to guide IB and its teams forward into 2021 and beyond. And so, weâ€™re inviting you to a Leadership Information Session, with Daron, who will discuss the various leadership opportunities available in IB. 

We strongly encourage you to attend, whether you are just curious about leadership or plan to step up and take on a new role. 

We will start promptly at 7:30!

We will be using the Zoom video conferencing system for this meeting. You can download the software to your computer, laptop, smartphone or tablet by visiting https://zoom.us/download. For very detailed instructions, visit the IB Zoom Tips & Tricks page.
