**Get Out The Vote time in Arizona!    Weekend calling on the central campaign zoom!**

The Mission for Arizona campaign,  for Biden for POTUS, Mark Kelly for Senate, and Dems down the ballot, is asking all weekend callers to join them in their central zoom phone bank hub.  Centralizing phone banking during GOTV helps campaign staff react quickly to issues that come up, particularly around voter protection.  Campaign staff will offer a quick training and support throughout the event on the chat. 

You can sign up for one or more shifts, or If you're on a roll, you can just stay for an extra shift without repeating the training (unless you want to). Pick any shift! But If you'd like to (hopefully) see your IB friends there too.....

**Join us on Sunday, Oct 18, 2-4pm:** **[ThruTalk: Weekend Zoom Hub Sign-Ups](https://www.mobilize.us/missionforaz/event/312513/)**

**Note:**  We recommend the ThruTalk automated dialer for experienced  phone bankers, but give it a try! It's an automated dialer -- faster, and has a higher contact rate.  It also masks your personal phone number.  \
**Questions?** You'll get great training materials from the campaign! But feel free to call us before event if you have questions: phonebank\+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org.
