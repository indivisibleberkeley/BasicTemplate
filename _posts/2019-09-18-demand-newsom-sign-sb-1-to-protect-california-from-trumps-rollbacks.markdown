The Governor is threatening to veto Senate Bill 1, the most important environmental bill this year. **Please call Governor Newsom today to help make sure he signs this vitally important bill.** 

SB 1 resists the Trump Administration’s rollback of key federal environmental protections.

It makes sure that state environmental laws—the California Endangered Species Act, the California Clean Air Act, and major state water laws—fill in any gaps in environmental protection created by the Trump rollbacks. 

The bill faced major opposition from certain agricultural and water agency interests that fear the bill will force scientific information to be taken into account as new water projects are considered. **These interests support Trump’s environmental rollback agenda, and now they have the Governor’s ear.**

Governor Newsom even asked the bill’s author, Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, to shelve the bill until next year, as described in this LA Times piece.  But even with this vehement opposition, Senator Atkins persisted and brought the bill up for a vote in the legislature. Both houses passed it in the final hours of the legislative session. 

Now, Governor Newsom is threatening to side with the Trump Administration and veto SB 1.

We cannot let that happen. It would be bad for California, bad for Newsom, and bad for the planet. **Support California’s environment today and call Governor Newsom at 916-445-2841 to urge him to sign SB 1 when it gets to his desk. If you do not get an answer, please leave a message. Every call counts!**

You can say:

*My name is [YOUR NAME] I am a resident of California, and I’m calling to urge Gov. Newsom to sign SB 1.* 

*SB 1 would protect California from the effects of recent and future environmental protection rollbacks by the Trump administration. Vetoing SB 1 would be a rash decision based on false information and signal that Governor Newsom agrees with the Trump Administration’s water policy. That would be detrimental to California.*
