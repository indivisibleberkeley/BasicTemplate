### Overview
The US Forest Service is proposing harmful rule changes that would eliminate public input and environmental assessments for most projects in our national forests. Help stop this by submitting a comment to EPA   

### Take Action
**Submit your Comment to EPA.** By August 12th, [click here to submit your comment at regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=FS-2019-0010-0001).  View the proposed rule change [here](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=FS-2019-0010).

*Note: You do not need to be an expert to comment. By law the agency must provide a written response to the comments it receives. In addition your comments may provide material for organizations that will likely sue the US Forest Service if this proposed rule is adopted. Background information and possible comments follow but personalizing your remarks enhances them.*  

### Suggested Comment
If this rule change proposed on 6/13/19 is adopted most commercial logging in US National Forests will occur without public knowledge or involvement and with no environmental assessment. This rule rollback would accomplish what loggers have been trying to do for years! This rule change will lead to more logging in National Forests at a time when we need less commercial logging. Forests provide habitat for our diminishing wildlife and sequester carbon which helps to reduce the effects of global warming. Deforestation is a major contributor to climate change. We do not need rule changes that will hasten deforestation.  

The proposed rule change adds seven new categorical exclusions and expands two existing categorical exclusions from environmental assessment and public scoping requirements. Public scoping, i.e. soliciting public comments, usually occurs in the early stages of project development. The Forest Service has estimated that up to 75% of its decisions would be affected by this rule change and that the public scoping requirement would be eliminated for all but two percent of its projects (those that would still be subject to an environmental impact statement [EIS]). It is important that this scoping requirement not be taken away from the project approval process. While the Forest Service claims it needs the proposed rule changes to increase efficiency,
undermining NEPA’s (National Environmental Policy Act) principles of governmental transparency, accountability, public involvement and science-based decision making is not going to make the Forest Service more efficient. It’s efficiency problems are a result of inadequate funding, high turnover and insufficient training.  

As a result of the new exclusions “fuels and timber” or “ecosystem restoration” projects on 7300 acres or less (which can include commercial logging on 4200 acres or less) would no longer be subject to environmental review or public scoping! For many National Forests this size project accounts for well over the majority of its proposed projects. These projects typically include prescribed burns, herbicide use and tree thinning as well as commercial logging. The threat of worsening wildfires has become a pretext for logging on public lands though often it has no impact on reducing wildfire risks. We need more research on the best ways to protect our forests from the ravages of wildfires not the willy-nilly logging of our forests that this proposed rule change would increase.  

The Forest Service has had a long-standing policy of only constructing temporary roads that must be decommissioned at the end of a project. Yet this rule’s new categorical exclusions would allow the building of up to five miles of new road or 10 miles of reconstruction of Forest Service roads with no environmental oversight.  

Similarly, the conversion of illegal off-road vehicle routes to official Forest Service roads would be excluded from environmental review and public scrutiny. We do not want a rule change that makes it easier to build new roads in our national forests! The addition of more roads denigrates the quality of our forests and literally paves the way for more undesirable logging projects in the future.  

One of the most egregious changes would eliminate the need for environmental impact statements (EISs) for projects in Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) and potential wilderness areas. These are the areas designated as most important for protecting fragile ecosystems and wildlife. Taking away protection of these areas by eliminating thorough environmental assessments is an abdication of the Forest Service’s responsibility to protect our national forests!  

The fact that this rule change would allow oil and gas exploration that lasts less than one year (but could include road construction, bore hole drilling, seismic testing and as much as three miles of pipeline construction or the construction of four drill sites) to proceed without an environmental assessment or public scoping is also a dereliction of duty. Tremendous damage to a forest and water bodies within forests can occur even if the exploration process lasts less than a year. The thought that these projects might occur without public knowledge is very upsetting. We do not need to explore for new oil and gas sites in our national forests. Our priority needs to be developing alternatives to fossil fuels, This is what our scientists and public opinion polls are telling us.  

While the Forest Service is claiming that this rule change will enable it to eliminate a backlog of more than 5000 permit applications, it will undoubtedly result in more litigation which could slow projects down even more. Under NEPA rules all government agencies must conduct environmental assessments of projects which impact the environment. Obviously most projects of the US Forest Service meet this criterion. Ignoring NEPA procedures will result in ignoring environmental laws and the Endangered Species Act criteria for project approval. This proposed rule change would bring about poorer forest management, not improved efficiency.  

There is no doubt that the Forest Service is under pressure from the demands of an increase in the number and intensity of wildfires. Currently the Forest Service is spending over half its budget on wildfire suppression (while 25 years ago it was only spending about 15% of its budget on fighting wildfires). The federal government needs to recognize that global warming is threatening our national forests and budget accordingly. It can not abandon stewardship of our forests as it prepares to fight more wildfires.  

The proposed rule changes for the Forest Service need to be withdrawn. They will not accomplish their goal of improved efficiency but rather weaken protection of an important national resource.
