Would you like to get up-to-speed on all things policing and criminal justice reform in Berkeley and Alameda County? Our Racism and Criminal Justice Reform team has been hard at work on these issues for 3+ years. On Wednesday, July 15th, 7-8pm, theyâ€™ll hold a meeting for folks interested in learning the landscape of local anti-racist work (e.g., Audit the Sheriff, Police Review Commission amendment, safety concerns in local jails), and specify ways to get plugged into the team if so desired. RSVP by clicking the button on the left!

We will be using the Zoom video conferencing system for this meeting. You can download the software to your computer, laptop, smartphone or tablet by visiting [https://zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download). For very detailed instructions, visit the [IB Zoom Tips & Tricks page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0nC77XppLlZaSN_Sn9AeMpFMLEZG4ED9PfaOLoJuzE/edit).
