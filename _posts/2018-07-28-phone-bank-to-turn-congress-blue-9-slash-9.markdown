Help us flip nearby CD-10 and send Democrat Josh Harder to Washington! This is a tough race – Republicans are pouring money into the district to shore up the incumbent. But Harder is a strong, progressive candidate, and we can win this – but it will take all hands on deck.

WHAT YOU’ll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

**DATE:** Sunday, September 9

**Locations & Times:** 

Central Berkeley, near Sacramento **(1-4pm)** 

NOTE:  **Albany, 3-6pm, is closed** to new signups

Please RSVP, and we’ll get back to you with more details – Thank you!
