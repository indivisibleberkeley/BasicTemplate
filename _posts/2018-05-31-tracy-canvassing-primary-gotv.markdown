Our last chance to canvass in Tracy for the primary! There are many canvassing slots now through June 5th. You can view them all and sign up for whichever dates work for you. You can head down **Sunday June 3, Monday June 4 or Tuesday June 5** (Election Day!). 

**If you can canvass any of those days, please do both of the following:**

- Sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFwEaRX9BAqP9C4Lj4CD_j5fyBv0sUdw9SAWPZUwIw3OzSUA/viewform) so the Tracy Dems know to expect you
