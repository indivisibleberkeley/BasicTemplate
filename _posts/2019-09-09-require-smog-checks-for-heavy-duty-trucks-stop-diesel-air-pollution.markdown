**Help us pass SB 210 to require heavy-duty trucks to pass smog tests.** This is a priority climate bill as the California Legislature adjourns for the year on September 13. If SB 210 is adopted the California Air Resources Board (CARB) will develop and implement a heavy-duty truck inspection and maintenance program similar to the smog check program for cars and pick-up trucks.  

**Call your Assemblymember Buffy Wicks in the next few days:** urge her to do everything possible to pass the heavy-duty truck smog check bill into law. Let the person answering the phone (call between 9am and 5pm if possible) know you are a constituent concerned about clean air in California.  

Assemblymember: Buffy Wicks: (916) 319-2015  

If outside this area, you can find your representatives at http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/  

Heavy duty diesel trucks are a major source of air pollution in California. The current system relies on self inspections and random inspections by CARB at various locations to keep the exhaust systems of these trucks working properly. The system is not working.  

* SB 210 would improve air quality and public health in communities currently choking on smog, which are disproportionately low-income communities.  
* Heavy-duty vehicles produce five times the particulate matter of ALL other on-road vehicles. These particulates contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  
* Diesel trucks account for 45% of vehicle nitrogen oxide emissions that react in the atmosphere to form smog.  
* SB 210 would create a level playing field for truckers who maintain their vehicles but must compete with operators who do not.  

SAMPLE CALL SCRIPT:  

My name is ______. I am a constituent of Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks. I am calling to urge her to vote YES on SB 210. Ask if she plans on voting Yes on SB 210, if she does please thank her and request that she urges others to vote YES as well. This bill is critical for improving and protecting the health of Californians. It is time to require that owners of heavy duty trucks properly maintain their exhaust systems as drivers of automobiles are required to do.
