Join Indivisible Berkeley as we canvass 10:00-3:00 in Tracy to Get Out The Vote (GOTV) on March 3rd,  Primary Election day! Help us ensure that Josh Harder is #1 of the top two candidates moving on to the November ballot, while also supporting several down-ballot candidates to build the bench of Dem office holders in CA-10.
