ELECTION EVE!  We’ll be calling for our targeted races for Congress at each event.  Both are MUST WINS if we want to put a check on the Republican agenda.

Josh Harder for Congress, Josh is a strong, progressive candidate in a very tight race in neighboring CD-10 (Tracy, Modesto).

Jacky Rosen for the Nevada Senate seat. Remember, the Senate confirms Supreme Court and other nominees.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5:

1-4pm, PHONE NEVADA VOTERS at homes in the Berkeley Hills and Berkeley Elmwood area.

4-7pm, PHONE FOR JOSH HARDER  at a home in the Berkeley Elmwood area.

Please RSVP soon – space may be limited, and this helps us plan if more space is needed.

Then look for an email with subject "Indivisible Berkeley” in the next few days so you’ll know where to go!
