We're in the final stretch. Just four days are between us and Election Day. What will **you** do today to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats downballot?

Indivisible Berkeley is thrilled to be working with three fantastic campaigns during the final days of the election: re-electing Josh Harder to Congress, working to elect Democrats in Michigan, and flipping Arizona blue. We won't be hosting our own phone banks during this time--instead, you should sign up with the campaigns directly! Below, we have listed the shifts for each campaign. Sign up for as many as you can!

**Please keep track of your calls and conversations [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciXaJbyMpPyk1Vc50wSdJlR0YiCBxo8zmrSXgzPqPeI-DwoQ/viewform)**. We‚Äôd love to know the amazing work our volunteers are doing, so we‚Äôd like to tally up our successes!

If you have any questions, contact us at [phonebank+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org](mailto:phonebank+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org). Let's win this thing.
