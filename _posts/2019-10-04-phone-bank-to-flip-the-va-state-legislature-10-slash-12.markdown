Join Indivisible Berkeley and East Bay Activist Alliance in phoning Virginia voters!  This is a “last chance” election before redistricting. We’re supporting 3 campaigns: Cheryl Turpin for VA Senate District 7; Alex Askew and Nancy Guy for House of Delegates.

WHY VIRGINIA? In 2017, 1 single vote decided control of the Virginia House of Delegates. The party in control after this election will draw up Virginia’s US congressional district maps and affect national elections. Each vote really matters!

Republicans spent decades working to control state legislatures and gerrymandering to create their majorities. We can’t cede state level races to them. Let's Get Out The Vote!

Please RSVP for more details.
