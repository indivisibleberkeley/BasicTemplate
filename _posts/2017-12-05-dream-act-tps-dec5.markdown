call-script-text: "[Note: Senator Harris and Representative Lee already took the DREAMer
  pledge! They needs a thank you and encouragement to STAND STRONG this week. And
  a reminder to protect TPS recipients as well.]\n\n[For Senator Feinstein:]\nCaller:
  Hello! My name is [name] and I’m calling from Berkeley. I'd like to know about Senator
  Feinstein's position on passing the DREAM Act with this week's Continuing Resolution.\n\nStaff:
  Well, she definitely supports the DREAM Act. And definitely voted \"No\" on the
  tax bill last week [distraction!]. \n\nCaller: That’s great, but it’s going to take
  more than talk and tweet storms to keep 800,000 DACA recipients from falling into
  Trump’s deportation machine. Will the Senator take the “DREAMer Pledge”? The DREAMer
  Pledge is a commitment to vote \"NO\" on any Continuing Resolution that does not
  include the DREAM Act.\n\n[Note: if the staffer says Feinstein will take the DREAMer
  Pledge, ask to get that in email form. As soon as you hang up, please email us at
  [info@indivisibleberkeley.org](mailto:info@indivisibleberkeley.org) to let us know
  that we're making major progress!]\n\nCaller: Please also prioritize protections
  for some of the most vulnerable immigrants who *are* documented, those who have
  Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Thank you!"

The tax battle is sent back to the house, and more importantly, *the Senate and House must BOTH pass a spending bill by the end of this week!*

### Now's our chance to win protections for the DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants!

The DREAM Act would make permanent the protections for immigrants who arrived in the US as young children, aka DACA/DREAMers.

Trump's newest targets are tens of thousands of Haitian refugees (from the 2010 earthquake and cholera epidemic) and other refugees who were granted so-called "Temporary Protected Status" (TPS) to stay in the US while their countries rebuild. Trump has decided to end TPS for these refugees.

Call our Senator Dianne Feinstein and tell her she is not allowed to approve the spending bill ("Continuing Resolution") unless it includes the DREAM Act. Also give Senator Harris and Representative Lee a call to thank them for already pledging to vote "NO" on the CR unless it includes the DREAM Act. (And in *all three* calls, also urge them to enact protections for TPS recipients.)
