**Help Fight Voter Suppression!  Together as a group -- but virtually!**

That's what we'll be doing with our friends at *East Bay Activist Alliance* and *Reclaim Our Vote*, a coalition of civil rights and voting rights groups.  We'll be calling to help register people of color who live in key battleground states, but who are discouraged from voting by state restrictive barriers.  We'll be calling people who don't often get political phone calls, and we'll be leaving messages. 

**VIRTUAL PHONE Banking** --   Out of concern for our fellow activists' health, IB is offering **virtual activities only **for awhile as we monitor the coronavirus situation.  But our work is needed as much as ever, and it's a lot more fun if we can stay involved and together during this difficult period.  

If you're new to phone banking or to Zoom, we'll help! We'll be using Zoom software, which we used for our last General Assembly.  We'll do a virtual group training together, and the trainers will be available to answer questions.  You can also chat with others or comment to the group as you're making your calls!

Please RSVP by Friday, March 20 to participate.  And if you're not an IB member, please join when you sign up so we can keep you posted.

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or computer and your cell phone (or landline).
