JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) was already the biggest financier of extreme fossil fuels on Wall Street, but now the bank has doubled down, increasing its investments in devastating fossil fuels by over $4 billion last year. Chase is putting bankers’ bonuses ahead of supporting communities and the planet.

We will take our fight to the banks themselves and let them know we won’t tolerate threats to clean water, clean air, and Indigenous rights.
