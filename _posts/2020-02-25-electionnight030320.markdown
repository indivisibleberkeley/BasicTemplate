Super Tuesday is March 3, 2020. 

FINALLY, the CA Primary is part of Super Tuesday. Hooray!
Come watch election results with us at Spats. Drink, eat, meet and greet as election returns roll in from all over the country. 

Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Democrats Abroad, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia will all hold their presidential primaries on that date.

First come first served for seating - it may well fill up!

Co-hosted by: Indivisible Berkeley, Indivisible East Bay, East Bay Activist Alliance, SwingLeft East Bay, Wellstone Democratic Renewal Club.
