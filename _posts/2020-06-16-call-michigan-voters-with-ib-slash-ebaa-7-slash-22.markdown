### FLIP THE MICHIGAN STATE LEGISLATURE!

That’s what we’ll be doing, along with our partners in the East Bay Activist Alliance. We’ll be calling Michigan voters to support Laurie Pohutsky, who won her seat in the Michigan State House by fewer than 300 votes 2 years ago, and who needs our support!   The Michigan State House is narrowly Republican-controlled, so we need to protect incumbents in tight districts and flip red seats blue! And getting people out for their local candidates helps Dems up and down the ballot -- a multiplier effect!

We’ll be using Zoom videoconferencing software for this event. We’ll do a quick group training together, and trainers will be available to answer questions. 

Please RSVP as soon as possible so we can email you the log-in information for the event.

**WHAT YOU’LL NEED**: a charged iPad, tablet, or computer; and your cell phone (or landline).
