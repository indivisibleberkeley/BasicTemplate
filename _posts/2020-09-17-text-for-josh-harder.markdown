Help Re-Elect Josh Harder by Texting from Home!

In 2018 we successfully helped get Josh Harder elected to the House of Representatives, representing Congressional District CA-10 (Tracy/Modesto). Now, he's running a competitive campaign for re-election, and he needs our help to win!

You can [text with the Josh Harder campaign](https://www.mobilize.us/harderforcongress/event/325656/) on Saturdays and Sundays, times may vary, virtually on Zoom. Each text bank includes a training on OutVote, the platform the campaign uses to send texts.

You can sign up for a text banking shift and find out more on [Josh Harder's website](https://www.mobilize.us/harderforcongress/event/325656/).
