We're in the final stretch. Just eight days are between us and Election Day. What will **you** do today to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Democrats downballot?

Indivisible Berkeley is thrilled to be working with three fantastic campaigns during the final days of the election: re-electing Josh Harder to Congress, working to elect Democrats in Michigan, and flipping Arizona blue. We won't be hosting our own phone banks during this time--instead, you should sign up with the campaigns directly! Below, we have listed the shifts for each campaign. Sign up for as many as you can! We need as much help as you can possibly give; we don't need to convince you that this is one of the most pivotal elections of our lifetime.

To keep a sense of community alive, though, we are offering a few events for IB!
