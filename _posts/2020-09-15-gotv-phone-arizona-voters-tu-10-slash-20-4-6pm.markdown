**Get Out The Vote -- and flip this swing state!**

Early voting started October 7, and the race is tight! Arizona is a key battleground state-- for the presidency and the senate.  So we're calling  Arizona voters to help and encourage them to vote SOON, so they can be sure their votes will be counted!  We’ll be calling with the Arizona Democratic Party’s coordinated campaign, “Mission for Arizona,” supporting Joe Biden for POTUS, Mark Kelly for Senate, ,Senate candidate Mark Kelly and all Democratic candidates on the ballot.   We can flip the white house, U.S. Senate and the Arizona state house if we push hard! Join us!

We'll be working together on zoom, and we'll provide training and support throughout the phone bank.

**What you'll need:** a computer, tablet or ipad, and your phone.

**RSVP as soon as possible**, preferably before the hour preceding our start time or we may miss you! Earlier is better, so that we can send you info you'll want to read, and can answer questions or offer tech support. by phone before the event.
