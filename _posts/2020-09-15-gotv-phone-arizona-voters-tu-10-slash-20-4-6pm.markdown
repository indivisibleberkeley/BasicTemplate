**Get out the vote and flip this critical swing state!**

The Mission for Arizona campaign, to elect Biden as POTUS, Mark Kelly to the Senate, and Dems down the ballot, is now asking us to join them in their central zoom phone bank hub where we'll work with phone volunteers from all over the country! Campaign staff will offer a quick training and support throughout the event on the chat.

You can sign up for one or more shifts, or if you're on a roll, you can just stay for an extra shift without repeating the training (unless you want to). Pick any shift! But If you'd like to (hopefully) see your IB friends there too -- 

**Join us on Tuesday, Oct 20, 4-6pm on the Arizona campaign's zoom!**

* If you'd like to call using the updated VPB Connect dialer** **(similar to what we've been using), sign up[ ](https://mblz.io/0ic1oG)**[HERE](https://mblz.io/0ic1oG)**[ ](https://mblz.io/0ic1oG)!


* Or sign up **[HERE](https://mblz.io/4PVM8G)** if youâ€™d like to join those of us who will be using  the ThruTalk  automated dialer! Give it a try! It's faster, with a higher contact rate.
