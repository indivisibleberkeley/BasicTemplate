IB phone bankers are working hard to get out the vote and flip the Virginia State Legislature! Last chance before redistricting this gerrymandered state -- next opportunity is not until 2031! You can support this effort, even if you're not phoning! We need:

* **Sign-in Volunteers** to sign in and orient phone volunteers, direct them to a table, give them printed instructions, and direct them to a trainer if needed. (And keep the hot water going! :)

* **Food Volunteers** to keep our callers happy and motivated!

  * Suggest finger foods that keep well at room temp and aren't messy (no frosting, dips, sauces -- we're using napkins only or maybe compostable small plates).

  * Possibilities: fruit that keeps well (like organic apples, clemantines), cheese, peanut butter and crackers, nuts, cookies, banana bread, etc. Fresh-baked is great, but not a must!!)

Please RVSP soon! And heartfelt thanks from the phone force!
