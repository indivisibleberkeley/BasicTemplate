CAN'T TRAVEL OR PHONE? YOU CAN STILL BE PART OF GOTV THIS YEAR! Help our IB phone banks out! Our phone bankers will be working long hours from October 26-November 5 to get out the vote and flip the Virginia State Legislature. Last chance before redistricting this gerrymandered state -- next opportunity is not until 2031! You can support this effort! We need:

* **Sign-in Volunteers** to sign in and orient phone volunteers, direct them to a table, give them printed instructions, and direct them to a trainer if needed. (And keep the hot water going! :)

* **Food Volunteers** to bring food to these events -- so our phoners stay fed, happy and motivated to keep calling!

  * Suggest finger foods that keep well at room temp.

  * Possibilities: fruit that keeps well (like organic apples, clemantines), cheese, peanut butter and crackers, nuts, cookies, banana bread, etc. Fresh-baked is great, but not a must!!)

RSVP [HERE](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/8050e49aea72fa1fc1-gotv) -- soon! Thanks!
