**Can't travel or phone voters? You can still be part of GOTV and help flip Virginia!** **If Democrats win the State Legislature, we'll see more Democrats in our US Congress for the next decade.  ** Our phone bankers will be working long hours from November 1-5 to Get Out The Vote and flip the Virginia State Legislature. This is a "last chance" election  before the party in control redistricts this gerrymandered state -- next opportunity is not until 2031!   Can you help? ** **We need:

**Food Volunteers (by October :** to bring simple finger foods to these events -- so our phoners stay fed, happy and motivated to keep calling! Please sign up by October 30!

**Sign-In Volunteers:** to sign in and orient phone volunteers, direct them to a table, give them printed instructions, and direct them to a trainer if needed.  (And maybe keep the hot water going!)
