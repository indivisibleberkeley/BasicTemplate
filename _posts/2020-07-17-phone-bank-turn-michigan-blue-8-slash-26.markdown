Join us as we call Michigan voters to support Democratic candidates for every level of government: President, Senate, US House, and State Legislature. The Michigan State House and Senate are both narrowly Republican-controlled; there are several competitive seats at the Congressional/Senate level; and of course, Michigan is a pivotal state in the Electoral College. We will be working with the Michigan Democratic Party to protect incumbents in tight districts and flip red seats blue!

We’ll be using Zoom videoconferencing software for this event. We’ll do a quick group training together, and trainers will be available to answer questions throughout the event. 

Please RSVP as soon as possible so we can email you the log-in information for the event. 

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: a charged iPad, tablet, or computer; scratch paper,and your cell phone (or landline).
