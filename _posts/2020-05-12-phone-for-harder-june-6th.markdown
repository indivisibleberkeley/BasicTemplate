**Get Out The Vote for Congressman Josh Harder**

In 2018 we were successful helping to elect Josh Harder to the House of Representatives, representing Congressional District CA-10 (Tracy/Modesto). Now he is running for reelection and Republicans are highly motivated to regain that seat.

We’re helping to reach out to voters in District 10 to determine the issues most important to them and to explore if they need help at this difficult time. We will remind them of Josh’s accomplishments, and help inform them of resources for voting.

IB is offering online”virtual only” activities as we all deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Our work remains important and we continue to do it as and maintain contact with each other using the Zoom app.

If you are new to phone banking or to Zoom, we are here to help. We’ll do online training together. Trainers will be available throughout to answer questions. You’ll be able to request help in a private conversation at any time during the phone bank if you choose.

Please RSVP to participate so we can email you instructions for joining the event.

If you are not currently an IB member, we encourage you to join when you sign up so we can keep you posted about upcoming IB events.

What You’ll Need: A charged ipad, tablet, or computer and your cell phone or landline.

We’re happy to answer questions at: phonebank\+owner@indivisibleberkeley
