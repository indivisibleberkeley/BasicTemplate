### Help Fight Voter Suppression! 

That's what we'll be doing for *Reclaim Our Vote*, a coalition of civil rights and voting rights groups. We'll be calling to help register people of color who live in key battleground states, but who are discouraged from voting by state restrictive barriers. We'll be calling people who don't often get political phone calls, and we'll be leaving messages.

VIRTUAL PHONE BANKING:  Out of concern for our fellow activists' health, IB is offering virtual activities only for awhile as we monitor the coronavirus situation.  But our work is needed as much as ever, and it's a lot more fun if we can work together during this difficult period.

We'll be using Zoom videoconferencing software for this event .  We'll do a quick  group training together, and trainers will be available to answer questions.  You can also ask for help  or comment to the group as you're making your calls!

Please RSVP by midnight Tuesday, March 31 so we can mail you the login information the morning of the event.

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or computer and your cell phone (or landline).
