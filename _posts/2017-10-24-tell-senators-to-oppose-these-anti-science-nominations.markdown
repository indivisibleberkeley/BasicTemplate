  Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

  I am calling to urge the Senator to oppose Barry Lee Myers to lead NOAA and Andrew Wheeler to be Deputy Administrator for EPA. The Trump administration continues its attempt to fill federal agencies and departments with leaders whose interests and experiences lie, not in science-driven protections for the public, but in promoting the interests of powerful polluting industries. Among these nominees, there are none with strong public health, science and environmental protection credentials, who will put facts and the public first.

  Thank you for your time and attention.

### Background

The Trump administration continues its attempt to fill federal agencies and departments with leaders whose interests and experiences lie, not in science-driven protections for the public, but in promoting the interests of powerful polluting industries. In total, Trump’s nominees represent an unparalleled action to place industries in power throughout government. Among these nominees, there are none with strong public health, science and environmental protection credentials, who will put facts, science and the public first.  

Votes may come up for full Senate votes at any time, so please call or write now.

**Barry Lee Myers to lead NOAA** – As CEO of a private weather service, Accuweather, he has a conflict of interest, and as a non-scientist he has no experience with NOAA’s vast responsibilities related to oceans, fisheries and coastlines.  He has clashed with NOAA about what he called unfair competition.  Critics are concerned that he will use his position for competitive advantage and minimize the National Weather Service’s role.  
 
**Andrew Wheeler to be Deputy Administrator for EPA** – Wheeler is a lobbyist for the giant Murray Energy coal company and was a senior aide to Senator Inhofe, a strong critic of EPA who denies climate change.
