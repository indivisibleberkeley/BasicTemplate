Textbanking is an efficient and fun way to connect with voters, and research is finding that it is also quite effective.
While we all need to practice social distancing, textbanking will be an even more important way of contacting voters than before.
Join us for a 2-hour orientation to texting and learn what it's all about, and what you need to get started.
Get set up to text with a group or on your own, and get your questions answered.
