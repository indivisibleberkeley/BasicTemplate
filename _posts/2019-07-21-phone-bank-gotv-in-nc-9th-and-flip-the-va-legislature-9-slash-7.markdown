We'll be calling North Carolina 9th voters to get out the vote. The special congressional election, with Democrat Dan McCready running against Republican Dan Bishop is September 10! 

We may also call VA voters to Flip the VA Legislature!   Join us!

WHAT YOU"LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.
