Please consider joining the Mass Poor Peopleâ€™s Assembly and Moral March on Washington. Originally conceived as an actual Mass March on Washington, in the spirit of Dr. King's 1963 March on Washington For Jobs and Freedom, the Covid-19 Pandemic has required the event to be re-imagined as a virtual event.
The organizers behind the March, including Rev. William Barber, are on a mission to end the interlocking injustices of systemic racism, poverty, militarism, ecological devastation, and the distorted moral narrative of religious nationalism. Based on their agenda, Barbara Lee just called for defunding the Pentagon to the tune of $350B. 

Our RCJR team strongly encourages you to join any of three sessions (Saturday 7-9:30am, 3-5:30pm, or Sunday 3-5:30pm).
