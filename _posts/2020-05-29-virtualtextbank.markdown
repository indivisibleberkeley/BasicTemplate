For our June party, we’re encouraging texters to sign up to attend the Open Progress (OP) “How to Text with Text Troop” webinar on Saturday, June 27 from 12 pm-1 pm here [https://calendly.com/text-troop/how-to-text?month=2020-06&date=2020-06-27] then join us afterward from 1-2 pm to continue the texting party with friends. RSVP here [https://actionnetwork.org/events/june-texting-party/]. OP will provide the training you need to learn how to text with them and the textbank will be a social texting gathering where we help each other handle texts and practice using the tools we learned in OP’s training just before. So please sign up on both of those links to participate in our 4th Saturday texting party!
