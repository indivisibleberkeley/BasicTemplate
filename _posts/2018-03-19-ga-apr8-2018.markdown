Join us on April 8 for the next Indivisible Berkeley General Assembly featuring the IB Science & Environment Team. The team has invited speakers from the Union of Concerned Scientists and other organizations to discuss timely issues and ways to take constructive action. Please join us to learn how you can support science and the environment in this challenging time.

The S&E Team will have **specific actions and ways to contribute**. So come on down and bring a friend!

Doors open at 7. We start promptly at 7:30.

Our [pre-GA training](http://indivisibleberkeley.org/event/pre-ga-training-staying-in-the-loop) will be on how to stay in the loop with IB. This session will be great for new members or folks who want to receive more information from certain issue teams. IB Steering Team member Daron will be leading the training.
