Why Michigan?  Due to partisan gerrymandering and voters' rights restrictions, Republicans hold a drastically unfair advantage and are over-represented in the Michigan state legislature. It’s critical for Democrats to win seats in 2018 to make blue inroads in this presidential battleground state -- before 2020. So we're partnering with [Sister District](https://www.sisterdistrict.com/teams/california/ca13) and phoning for Democratic candidates Mallory McMorrow (for State Senate) or Padma Kuppa (for State House of Representatives).

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

RSVP soon – space may be limited, and this helps us plan if more space is needed.

Then look for an email with subject ‘Indivisible Berkeley” in the next few days so you’ll know where to go!
