Join the Tracy Dems Oct. 17,18, 24, and 25 to drop literature for Josh Harder and down-ballot candidates.  We can't canvass this year, but we can still help support Josh Harder and other down-ballot candidates by sharing important information with voters.  Bring a friend or family member from your bubble and have fun while you're helping out these candidates.
