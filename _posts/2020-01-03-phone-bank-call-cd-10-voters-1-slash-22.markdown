**Re-elect Josh Harder!**

We worked hard to elect Josh Harder in 2018, and he now represents California's Congressional District 10 (Tracy/Modesto) in the House of Representatives. Josh is now  running for re-election, and the primary is March 3! Republicans are out in force to take this seat back. Some of his opponents in this "jungle primary" are Republicans with long tenures as local officials, and they have high name recognition. The top 2 in this primary -- regardless of party -- become the nominees in the general election. Help us call to get voters to the polls for Josh on March 3!

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you. If you can, be green and bring your own water bottle! We'll provide snacks.
