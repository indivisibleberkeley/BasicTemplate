call-script-text: "CALL as soon as possible (before Monday, August 31, 2020)\nSenator
  Nancy Skinner - (916) 651-4009\nAssembly member: Buffy Wicks - (916) 319-2015\nIf
  outside this area, you can find your representatives at http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/\n
  \ \n     The first two bills (AB 841 and AB 326)  have less than a week to get off
  of the senate floor, move to the assembly, get through committees, and pass the
  assembly floor.  Call your CA State Assembly member and CA Senator to urge support.
  \n      AB 3214 was passed in the CA Assembly in June 2020 and is currently in the
  CA Senate. Call your Senator.\n\nSCRIPT suggested for phone call\nDear representative,\n
  \    Please support AB 841 and AB 326 to improve the quality of our environment.
  \ AB 841 improves the energy efficiency and healthy spaces in our school buildings.
  This bill also adds good, clean jobs to install charging stations throughout the
  state.\n      AB 326 lowers the initial cost to lease electric cars and improves
  the car shopping experience by enabling leasing direct from the manufacturer on
  a month-to-month basis.\n----- The next paragraph is for calls to CA Senators ONLY,
  \n       since AB 3214 already passed in the Assembly.---\n\n       Protecting the
  environment from the catastrophic impact of oil spills requires strong deterrence.
  \ AB 3214 will double the current fines for spills and failure to clean spills,
  creating stronger pressure on oil companies to invest in proper preventative measures.
  \ \n\n--Add a personal statement about how these issues affect you--\n\n      Please
  support these bills and vote “YES”.  Thank you.\n\nKEY PROVISIONS\nHere are **AB
  841’s** key provisions.\n* Public schools will get some unused public dollars that
  have been set aside for energy efficiency.  Funds must be used to fix ancient plumbing
  problems and replace inefficient and polluting heating, ventilation and air conditioning
  systems.\n* AB 841 will accelerate the process for utilities to install electric
  vehicle charging stations around the state.  Also, good training is required for
  the installers. \n* The bill’s result will be healthier schools, less water waste,
  reduced electricity demand, less air pollution from power plants, less tailpipe
  pollution from cars and trucks and good jobs.\n\nA second bill, **AB 326**,  will
  lower the up-front costs to lease electric cars, greatly easing the transition from
  gasoline powered cars to electric vehicles.\n \n* The bill will allow electric vehicle
  manufacturers to lease month-to-month directly to consumers. \n* The bill is packed
  with consumer protections, including some that exceed protections in current law.\n*
  AB 326 allows consumers to start driving an electric vehicle without a big down-payment
  or long-term lease.\n \n AB 326 has the support of environmental groups and major
  consumer groups.  The bill is sponsored by a California electric vehicle manufacturer,
  Canoo.\n \nBecause the bill bypasses dealerships, consumers will sidestep dealers
  who have been known to engage in predatory lending practices or create obstacles
  for consumers.  The bill will accelerate electric vehicle use, especially by people
  who want to try the vehicles before making a final decision. People with modest
  incomes can make the switch to electric vehicles sooner.\n  \nThe third bill, **AB
  3214**, imposes higher fines related to knowingly spilling or discharging oil. Oil
  companies oppose higher penalties to avoid the consequences of lax precautions,
  cheap equipment and lower standards of maintenance.  These bills set higher penalties
  for failing to protect our environment and our people.  \n\n* AB 3214 doubles the
  financial penalty allowed for the knowing discharge or spill of oil into state waters.
  \ Existing law makes it a felony punishable by a fine of not less than $5,000 or
  more than $500,000 for each day a violation occurs. \n\n* This bill doubles the
  minimum and maximum fines for the knowing failure to clean up spills and discharges,
  for failure to notify the Office of Emergency Services or for failure to follow
  a spill contingency plan.  Existing law makes it a felony punishable by a fine of
  not less than $2,500 or more than $250,000 for each day a violation occurs for a
  first conviction, and, for a 2nd conviction, by a fine of not less than $5,000 or
  more than $500,000 for each day a violation occurs.  \n\n* Additional fines can
  be imposed based on the quantity of oil spilled or left without cleanup or notification.
  Fines related to quantity are allowed up to a maximum of $1,000 per gallon spilled
  in excess of 1,000 gallons of oil.\n"

ACTION: Please take action on 3 bills in the California legislature by phoning your representatives.   Assembly Bill 841 and Assembly Bill 326  both support the transition to a cleaner environment and support a robust economy with less reliance on fossil fuel.  The bills improve environmental quality by providing greener school buildings, adding electric vehicle charging stations, training installers and reducing the upfront costs to lease electric vehicles.  AB 3214  increases fines related to oil discharges or spills and fines for failure to clean up spills into California waters.
