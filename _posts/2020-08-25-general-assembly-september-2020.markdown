The September GA will be a virtual version of our sample ballot mark-up party. Bring a beverage of your choice to toast your favorite candidates and ballot initiatives!

We start promptly at **7:30**!

"Doors open" at 7 for socializing and tech troubleshooting. If you have never used Zoom before, we recommend you try connecting at 7 so if there is an issue one of our tech gurus can help you out before the meeting begins.

We will be using the Zoom video conferencing system for this meeting.
