We think California should be a voting rights leader, across the board.

This is why we're supporting the [Free the Vote](https://www.freethevoteca.org/) efforts led by the incredible organization [Initiate Justice](https://www.initiatejustice.org/) -- in coalition with ACLU of California, All of Us or None / Legal Services for Prisoners with Children (LSPC), Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC), Californians United for a Responsible Budget (CURB), League of Women Voters of California, People Over Profits San Diego, Vote Allies, White People for Black Lives (WP4BL) and California Secretary of State Alex Padilla.

Right now, nearly 50,000 Californians on parole pay taxes at the local, state, and federal levels but are not allowed to vote in any of those elections. They are working and living in our communities but are denied a voice in the policies that shape their lives. [You can learn more here.](https://www.freethevoteca.org/) but...

The first step is for the state legislature to pass ACA 6 - a constitutional amendment. The bill has made it through a bunch of committees, and will be up for a floor vote when the state legislature returns from recess -- so around or after August 12th, 2019. 

There are 3 Bay Area Assemblymembers who need to be messaged by their constituents and told to vote yes on ACA 6. 

Do you have friends who live in the areas below? 

*Frazier - [representing District 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%27s_11th_State_Assembly_district) - Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley, parts of Pittsburg, Isleton, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville
*Gray - [representing District 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%27s_21st_State_Assembly_district) - all of Merced county, some of Stanislaus: Ceres, Modesto, Newman, Patterson
*Grayson - [representing District 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%27s_14th_State_Assembly_district) - Clayton, Concord, Martinez, parts of Pittsburg, Pleasant Hill, Walnut Creek, Benicia, Vallejo

Can you be the one to reach out to them, explain this situation, and encourage them to call their Assemblymembers?

Your friends can [use this link to message state reps now to pass ACA 6](https://action.aclu.org/send-message/ca-asm-support-freethevote) - Free the Vote in California. They could also give their offices a call! Or both.

Unfamiliar with voting laws / parole / felonies? [This writeup from the League of Women Voters](https://www.lwvbae.org/league-news/restoring-the-right-to-vote-for-people-on-parole/) has more background on the history of this kind of disenfranchisement.
