**Get Out The Vote for Congressman Josh Harder**

In 2018 we successfully helped elect Josh Harder to the House of Representatives, representing Congressional District CA-10 (Tracy/Modesto). He's been a dynamic first-term Congress member! Now he is running for reelection and Republicans are highly motivated to regain his seat. Let's make sure that doesn't happen!

Please join the Josh Harder campaign for a phone banking session online, via Zoom. The campaign will provide a training and be available to answer any questions. Also, Barbara Montano, one of our IB Phonebank Captains will be on the call to provide additional support.

Please RSVP on the campaign's Mobilize site for August 27th at 5 pm.   

What you’ll need: A charged iPad, tablet, or computer (to view the phonebank details) and your cell phone or landline.

We’re happy to answer questions at phonebank+owner@indivisibleberkeley.
