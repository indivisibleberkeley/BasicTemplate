Join us* at our next meeting, on Thursday, Nov. 21st, 7:00-9:00 p.m.  We'll meet at 1301 Walnut St. in North Berkeley (in the block immediately north of Rose St. The house is across the street from the north end of the Live Oak Park tennis courts.) 

We'll report on and strategize about:
* our campaign to strengthen Berkeley's Police Review Commission by getting a Charter Amendment approved for the 2020 ballot.
* Mayor Arreguin's newly forming Working Group to address racial disparities in policing.
* the ongoing attempt to get a performance and financial audit of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office.

As always, we'll update each other on additional happenings concerning racism or criminal justice reform--and enjoy some light refreshments (contributions of food or drink are welcome but optional).

A quick and simple action: If you haven't already signed our online petition calling on the Mayor and City Council to put the Charter Amendment for a stronger Police Review Commission on the ballot, please go here and sign on:
