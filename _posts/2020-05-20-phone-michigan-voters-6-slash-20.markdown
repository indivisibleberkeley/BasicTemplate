### Help Flip Michigan Blue!

That’s what we’ll be doing, along with our partners in the East Bay Activist Alliance. We’ll be calling Michigan voters to support Laurie Pohutsky, running for re-election to the Michigan State House. Laurie won her last election by fewer than 300 votes and needs our support!  The Michigan State House is narrowly Republican-controlled, so we need to protect incumbents in tight districts and flip red seats blue! Bonus -- our work for Laurie brings out voters and benefits Democrats up and down the ballot! 

We’ll be using Zoom videoconferencing software for this event. After a quick group training, and trainers will be available to answer questions throughout the event. Trainers are also available to help you with any questions you may have before the event.

Please RSVP as soon as possible so we can email you the log-in information for the event.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: an iPad, tablet, or computer (for viewing the voter page and recording voters' answers) ; and your cell phone (or landline).
