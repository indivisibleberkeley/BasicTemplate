## Flipping Michigan
### On Legislating for Equity and Justice

Join EBAA for the third in a series of conversations between Michigan candidates and our California local legislators. Join Rep. Padma Kuppa (Metro Detroit) in conversation with Assemblyman Rob Bonta, 18th CA Assembly District, encompassing Alameda, San Leandro and parts of Oakland.  By flipping her seat in 2018, Kuppa became the first Democrat ever to represent Clawson and Troy, Michigan. Bonta is one of the strongest voices for justice and equity in the CA legislature.  Co-sponsored by Michigan House Dems and StateWide Indivisible Michigan.
