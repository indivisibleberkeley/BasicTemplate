call-script-text: Hi, my name is \[your name\] and I'm a constituent. \[give your
  address\]. I urge Senator Skinner to vote NO on AB 3163. AB 3163 would create more
  methane gas at a time when the state needs to move beyond carbon fuels. Again please
  vote no on this harmful bill. Thanks for your help on this urgent matter. If you
  get an answering machine, leave a message. Every call is counted.

**ACTION:** Call your state Senator and urge a no vote on AB 3163. California does not need an expensive and energy intensive process that turns trees into methane gas.

**CALL your State Senator today.**
Senator Nancy Skinner - **(916) 651-4009**
If outside this area, you can find your representatives at [http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/](http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/)

**SUMMARY POINTS:**
Assembly Bill 3163 would promote the costly and nonsensical conversion of woody biomass from the forests and orchards into methane gas. There is no reason to intentionally turn trees into an extremely potent climate pollutant as we stare down the dire consequences of a worsening climate crisis.

AB 3163 would divert focus away from zero-emission energies and enable a new, costly source of methane to be created, sold and burned by converting wood into methane gas. AB 3163 would expand the definition of “biomethane” to include gas that is manufactured through the thermal conversion of biomass.

● Thermal conversion turns woody residues that would likely decompose over a long period of time, and do not typically release significant volumes of methane, into methane which is burned and contributes to climate change and air pollution immediately. When methane leakage is accounted for, thermal conversion can increase climate pollution.

● AB 3163 would divert focus from more sustainable uses for woody agricultural residues, such as whole orchard reincorporation, which sequester carbon and improve soil health.

● AB 3163 would predominantly benefit industries that generate large amounts of woody waste like commercial loggers and large agricultural operations rather than consumers or cities .

● Despite claims made by this bill's proponents, decarbonization studies, such as the one released by Lawrence Livermore Labs earlier this year, emphasize conversion to hydrogen or liquid fuels, not methane. By creating a pathway for a costly process to create methane, a potent global warming pollutant, AB 3163 puts California on the wrong track to meeting its climate objectives.

**Suggested Script** (Please add summary points listed above as you wish.)
