Join us to continue 2019 canvassing in CD-10: Nov. 9, 10 am - 3 pm, in Tracy.  Please RSVP here to keep the momentum going from last year. 

If you can't join us in November, we'd still love to hear from you, especially if you'd like to canvass later this year: canvass+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org.  

We're looking forward to seeing you! 

Letâ€™s ensure Josh Harder is reelected, inspire voters to vote, and strengthen the Democratic base in this district. Many potential Democratic voters do not realize Josh was elected and do not know his name. We have work to do!
