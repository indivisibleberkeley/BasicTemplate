**Flip this critical swing state!**

Arizona is a key battleground state-- for the presidency and the senate. We need your help to flip red seats blue and re-elect Democrats at every level in Arizona. We'll be calling voters to help them to vote by mail and SOON, so they can vote safely and actually have it count!  We’ll be calling with the Arizona Democratic Party’s coordinated campaign, “Mission for Arizona,” supporting Senate candidate Mark Kelly and Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.   We can flip the white house, U.S. Senate and the Arizona state house if we push hard for the next few weeks! Join us!

We'll be working together on zoom, and we'll provide training and support throughout the phone bank.

**What you'll need:** a computer, tablet or ipad, and your phone.

**RSVP as soon as possible**, preferably before the hour preceding  our start time or we may miss you! Earlier is better, so that we can send you info you'll want to read, and can answer questions or offer tech support. by phone before the event.

One more thing -- this is our LAST locally-run phone bank for Arizona -- after this we're inviting you to join us on the campaign's central phone bank zoom and work with people from all over the country!  Check **[HERE](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/team/elections)** for more dates when we'll be calling Arizona, and for more of Indivisible Berkeley's election team events!
