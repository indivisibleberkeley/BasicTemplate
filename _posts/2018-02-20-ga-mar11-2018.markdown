Join us on March 11 for the next Indivisible Berkeley General Assembly. We will learn about ways to support the **gun safety / gun control** movement from Mark Chekal-Bain, and we will hear from our Economic Justice team about the **Break Up With Your Bank** campaign to move towards socially responsible banks and credit unions.

Both topics will have **specific actions and ways to contribute**. So come on down and bring a friend!

Doors open at 7. We start promptly at 7:30.

Our pre-GA training will be an introduction to the Marshall Ganz style of Public Narrative, hosted by IB Steering Team member Jaime.
