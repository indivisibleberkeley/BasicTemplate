**Let's Flip this Swing State!  Early voting starts tomorrow! **

Arizona is a key battleground state-- for the presidency and the senate. We need your help to flip red seats blue and re-elect Democrats at every level (including the state legislature) in Arizona. And we need to win by a wide margin, early, to forestall Republican challenges to the election results!  We'll be helping Arizonans to vote safely by mail -- and ASAP -- so their vote will be counted.   Join us!

Please RSVP as soon as possible, but definitely by 1/2 hour before our start time or we may miss you! Earlier is better, so that we can send you info you'll want to read, and can answer questions or offer tech support. by phone before the event.
