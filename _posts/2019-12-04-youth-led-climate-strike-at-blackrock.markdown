[Students for Climate Action](https://www.facebook.com/StudentsForClimateAction2019/) is returning with their second call to action: create a UC Green New Deal. The University of California is the largest employer and largest landowner in the 5th largest economy in the world. The actions of the UC system have the power to change the fate of the world's climate and transform global systems of social inequality.
