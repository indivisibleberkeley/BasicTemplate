Indivisible Berkeley & our friends at East Bay Activist Alliance are supporting the Center for Common Ground’s VOTER PROJECT by calling citizens who may have been dropped from the voter rolls or haven’t registered and need help to become voters – so that they can vote in the important NC9th Special Election on September 10! Registration closes September 3, so it's crunch time!

Dan McCready, Democrat is running against Republican Dan Bishop to represent NC9. The district is currently unrepresented due to electoral fraud by the Republican campaign in 2018. Registration ends September 3rd. Help us get voters out!
