**What**

To continue as an educational forum, to inform ourselves and others about choices voters will make in the 2020 election. What will we need to know in order to make informed choices? What are the positions of the candidates? How do those positions compare with each other in terms of health care cost, access and quality? How much will each cost, and who will pay? How long will they take to roll out?
