### Phone voters in this critical swing state and help flip it blue!

The Mission for Arizona campaign, supporting Joe Biden for POTUS, and Mark Kelly for Senate, needs YOUR help to win this hard-fought election! Choose 2 hour shifts at times good for you! Each shift includes training and support throughout the time you're on the zoom.  You can choose to call using the automated dialer, which has a higher contact rate and also masks your personal phone number, or OpenVPB, which many IB phone volunteers are used to.  Please -- sign up for as many events as you can!
