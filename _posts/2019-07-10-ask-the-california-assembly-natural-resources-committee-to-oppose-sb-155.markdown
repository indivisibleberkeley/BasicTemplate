### Action
Contact Assembly Member Buffy Wicks by July 7 and tell her you oppose SB 155. This bill could weaken Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs) and California’s transition away from fossil fuels.

### Contact Info
* Phone: 916-319-2015
* Email: <assemblymember.wicks@assembly.ca.gov>
  * Copy your email to the members of the Natural Resources Committee: assemblymember.friedman@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.flora@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.chau@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.eggman@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.garcia@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.limon@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.mathis@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.mccarty@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.melendez@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.muratsuchi@assembly.ca.gov, assemblymember.stone@assembly.ca.gov  

### Suggested Script
*I am happy purchasing my electricity from a Community Choice Aggregator such as East Bay Community Energy(EBCE) [or Marin Clean Energy (MCE) if you live in Contra Costa] rather than PG&E. My electricity is both cheaper and cleaner than that offered by PG&E. I am concerned that this bill now before the Assembly Natural Resources Committee will weaken Community Choice Aggregators by reducing their decision making powers over procurement. CCAs have been doing a better job than the big investor owned utilities in switching away from fossil fuels and at a price that is no higher and often lower. Please OPPOSE SB 155.*  

*SB 155 could turn the Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) process into a set of rigid procurement orders. The IRP process is meant to be the first step in helping California meet renewable energy targets outlined in SB 350. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is in the process of trying to determine optimal resource mixes for the future and how California’s many energy providers might meet these requirements. Discussion of some recently identified possibilities with the providers has yet to occur but could have a substantial impact on future IRPs.*  

*This bill could lock in procurement decisions for the next 10 years that would ultimately be more expensive than necessary and might actually slow down the transition away from fossil fuels. Procurement for longer term needs can be better met through adjustment of plans and more cooperation among various providers. As CCAs expand greater opportunities for joint projects should arise.*  

*At this stage it is important to maintain flexibility in the system. New CCAs are being created yearly and we need a system that will enable them to grow and innovate. They have been moving us away from fossil fuels faster than the large investor owned utilities. Please don’t squelch their growth by passing SB 155. In 2018 the newly created CCAs as well as all the other CCAs met their renewable, clean and reliable energy requirements. They did not require any waivers as did some direct access providers and one large investor owned utility. Energy procurement in California is in a state of flux, the CCAs are important vehicles for acquiring renewable energy at the faster pace we need. Please don’t hem in the CCAs by turning long term plans into orders. Oppose SB 155.*  

### Background
Check our previous action [Demand Protection for the Environment and Electric Ratepayers during PG&E’s Bankruptcy](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/action/demand-accountability-in-clean-energy-and-ratepayer-protections) for more information on the success and rapid growth of CCAs.  

The CCAs’ right to make energy procurement decisions for their customers was specified in AB 117 in 2002. Their mandate was to provide reliable clean and affordable energy. The ability to prioritize local clean energy resources was also granted to them.
