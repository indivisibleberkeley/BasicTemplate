### Call Michigan Voters!

We’ll be calling with the Michigan Democratic Party’s coordinated campaign, “One Campaign for Michigan,” working for Democratic party candidates for the Senate and down-ballot.

Michigan is a key battleground state-- for the presidency, the senate, and congress. Also at stake is the Michigan state house -- which is just 4 more seats away from a Democratic majority! We need your help to flip red seats blue and re-elect Democrats. Join us!

We’ll be using Zoom videoconferencing software for this event. Trainers will be available to answer questions and offer individual help. You can also ask for help or comment to the group as you’re making your calls!  

Please RSVP as soon as possible so we can email you the log-in information for the event.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: a charged iPad, tablet, or computer; and your cell phone (or landline).
