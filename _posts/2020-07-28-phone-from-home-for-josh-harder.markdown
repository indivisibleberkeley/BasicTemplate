Help Re-Elect Josh Harder by Phoning from Home!

In 2018 we successfully helped get Josh Harder elected to the House of Representatives, representing Congressional District CA-10 (Tracy/Modesto). Now, he's running a competitive campaign for re-election, and he needs our help to win!

You can phone bank for Josh Harder every **Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 5 - 6:30 pm** virtually, from your own home. At each phone bank, the campaign will provide a training on the script and software and be available to help you with any issues.

You can sign up for a phonebanking shift and find out more on [Josh Harder's website](https://www.mobilize.us/harderforcongress/event/283963/).
