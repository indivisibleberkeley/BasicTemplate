Help Re-Elect Josh Harder by Phoning from Home!

In 2018 we successfully helped get Josh Harder elected to the House of Representatives, representing Congressional District CA-10 (Tracy/Modesto). Now, he's running a competitive campaign for re-election, and he needs our help to win!

Starting on October 5th, you can phonebank for Josh Harder every **Monday - Friday from 6:00 - 8:00 pm** virtually, from your own home. At each phone bank, the campaign will provide a training on the script and software and be available to help you with any issues.

You can sign up for a phone banking shift and find out more on [Josh Harder's website](https://www.mobilize.us/harderforcongress/event/326788/).

You can also join the campaign for speed-dial phone banking every **Tuesday from 5:00 - 7:30 pm**! The dialer only connects you to a voter when you answer the phone, so you reach a lot more voters!

Check out [Josh Harder's website](https://www.mobilize.us/harderforcongress/event/326788/) to sign up for a [speed-dialing event](https://www.mobilize.us/harderforcongress/event/308876/?fbclid=IwAR0mngz7j7qwA6Z5NKZ8l4WjyeXV7aVxacBmiNajRAsUQ2b3f8hUGvY0xdc).
