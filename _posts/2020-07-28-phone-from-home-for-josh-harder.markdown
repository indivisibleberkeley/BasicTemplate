Help Re-Elect Josh Harder by Phoning from Home!

In 2018 we successfully helped get Josh Harder elected to the House of Representatives, representing Congressional District CA-10 (Tracy/Modesto). Now, he's running a competitive campaign for re-election, and he needs our help to win!

Starting on October 5th, you can phonebank for Josh Harder every **Monday - Friday from 6:00 - 8:00 pm** virtually, from your own home. At each phone bank, the campaign will provide a training on the script and be available to help you with any issues. The campaign has switched to using their auto-dialer, which only connects you to a voter when they answer the phone, so you reach a lot more voters! 

You can sign up for a phone banking shift and find out more on [Josh Harder's website](https://www.mobilize.us/harderforcongress/event/326788/).
