We will be canvassing on Saturday, October 20th for Democrat Josh Harder to flip CD-10 to Blue.

It will likely be in Manteca or Modesto and the hours are still being determined! (We have placeholder times in this post.)

To sign up, [email our canvassing captains](mailto:canvassing+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org).

It’s totally cool if you have never canvassed before. Joining in on these trips is a great way to get practice and familiarity with the work—and excitement—of going door-to-door to talk to real people.

If you’re nervous and you want to learn more about what it’s like, [feel free to get in touch with our canvassing captains](mailto:canvassing+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org) for more information.
