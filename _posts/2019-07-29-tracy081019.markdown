Join us to continue 2019 canvassing in CD-10: August 10, 10 am - 3 pm, in Tracy. Please RSVP here to keep the momentum going from last year. 

Letâ€™s ensure Josh Harder is reelected, inspire voters to vote, and strengthen the Democratic base in this district. Many potential Democratic voters do not realize Josh was elected and do not know his name. We have work to do!

If you can't join us on August 10, we'd still love to hear from you, especially if you'd like to canvass later this year: canvass+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org. We're looking forward to seeing you!
