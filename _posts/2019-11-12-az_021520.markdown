Join a Weekend of Action for Arizona
Saturday, February 15th - Monday, February 17, 2020 
Phoenix, AZ 

We will be joining a Swing Left -organized event for the weekend of Feb. 15 - 17. 

We'll be registering voters, asking voters to sign up for absentee voting, canvassing for state elections, and recruiting volunteers. Some supporter housing may be available. 

IBers will sign up through Swing Left, but our point person for this trip is Canvassing Captain Cheryl Fippen, clfippen@gmail.com, who is available now for your questions.

This is high season in AZ so the trip is filling up fast!
