**Time to Get Out The Vote time in Arizona!    Let's call with the Campaign!**

The Mission for Arizona campaign for Biden, Mark Kelly for Senate, and Dems down the ballot is asking all weekend callers to join them in their central zoom phone bank.  This helps campaign staff react quickly to voter protection issues that come up as we call voters.  So we're hoping you'll join us there!  Campaign staff will offer a quick training and support throughout the event on the chat. There are 2 -hour shifts today starting at  10am, 12pm and 2pm.  You can sign up for one or more shifts, or If you're on a roll, you can just stay for an extra shift without repeating the training (unless you want to)! Pick any shift! But If you can...

**Please sign up for one or more of these shifts, and maybe we'll all see each other there!**

**Join us Saturday, 10/17, 12-2pm: [OpenVPB: Weekend Zoom Hub Sign-Ups  ](https://www.mobilize.us/missionforaz/event/312751/)**

**Join us on Sunday, 10/18, 12-2pm:** **[ThruTalk: Weekend Zoom Hub Sign-Ups ](https://www.mobilize.us/missionforaz/event/312513/)**

Note: On Saturday, we'll be using OpenVPB to make calls, which we recommend for new callers or Safari browser users.  On Sunday, we'll be using ThruTalk, a fast automated dialer that results in a higher contact rate. (Not compatible with the Safari browser.)

**Questions?** You'll get great training materials from the campaign! But feel free to call us before event if you have questions: phonebank\+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org.
