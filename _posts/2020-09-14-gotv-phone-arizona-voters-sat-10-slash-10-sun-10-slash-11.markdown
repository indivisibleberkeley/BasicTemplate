**Time to Get Out The Vote in Arizona!    Join us on the central campaign zoom!**

Flip this critical swing state! The Mission for Arizona campaign,  for Biden for POTUS, Mark Kelly for Senate, and Dems down-ballot,  is now asking all volunteer phone bankers to join them in their central zoom phone bank hub.  This helps campaign staff react quickly to issues that come up, particularly around voter protection.   Campaign staff will offer a quick training and support throughout the event on the chat.

You can sign up for one or more shifts, or if you're on a roll, you can just stay for an extra shift without repeating the training (unless you want to)! Pick any shift -- they start at 10am! But If you'd like to (hopefully) see your IB friends there too...

Sign up **[HERE](https://www.mobilize.us/missionforaz/event/321029/?share_medium=native_share&share_context=event_detail_page&force_banner=true)** and join us **Saturday, 10/17,** **2-4pm**, on the Arizona campaign's zoom.  We'll   be using the familiar OpenVPB, similar to what we've been using.

Note: If you'd like to use ThruTalk, the campaign's automated dialer, sign up for Sunday, 10/18,  and join us from 2-4pm,  **[HERE](https://www.mobilize.us/missionforaz/event/321035/?share_medium=native_share&share_context=event_detail_page&force_banner=true)**.

**Tally for IB!** We'd love to know that our IB heroes are out there phoning, and we'd love to tally up our successes! So we have an ask -- can you fill out this **[TALLY FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciXaJbyMpPyk1Vc50wSdJlR0YiCBxo8zmrSXgzPqPeI-DwoQ/viewform)** after your phone bank shift? Thanks! 

**Questions?** You'll get great training materials shortly before the event from the campaign. But feel free to email us, preferably before the event date,  if you have questions. at **phonebank\+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org**.
