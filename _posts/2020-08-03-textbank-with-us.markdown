In July we sent over 11,000 texts with Resistance Labs to support Vote-by-Mail in Wisconsin and get New Yorkers to fill out the Census. Join us on Saturday, August 22 at 10 a.m. to textbank together again via Zoom. [RSVP](https://actionnetwork.org/events/august-texting-party/) by Wednesday, August 19 to get the details of who we will text with and what efforts we will text for via email a few days ahead of the Saturday session. 

First time texting or want to refine your texting skills? Email EBAATexting@gmail.com to set up a one-on-one training session before our August texting party so you can join us to text on Saturday, August 22!
