**Get Out The Vote for Congressman Josh Harder**

In 2018 we successfully helped elect Josh Harder to the House of Representatives, representing Congressional District CA-10 (Tracy/Modesto). He's been a dynamic first-term Congress member! Now he is running for reelection and Republicans are highly motivated to regain his seat. Let's make sure that doesn't happen!

Join us on Zoom to phone bank together online. If you're new to phone banking or Zoom, we're here to help! Trainers are available before and during the phonebank to answer any questions and get you set-up.

**Please RSVP as soon as possible, so we can email you the instructions in advance of the event.**

What you'll need: Your computer, laptop, or iPad (for viewing voters' screens and recording their answers) and your cell phone or landline.

Weâ€™re happy to answer questions at: phonebank\+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org
