Join the Josh Harder campaign from Oct. 31-Nov.3 to safely drop lit to voters in Turlock, Modesto, and Tracy! We can't canvass this year, but we can still help support Josh Harder and other down-ballot candidates by sharing this important information with voters.

* Saturday, October 31st, 10:00 am - 1:00 pm; 1:00 - 4:00 pm

* Sunday, November 1st, 10:00 am - 1:00 pm; 1:00 - 4:00 pm

* Monday, November 2nd, 10:00 am - 1:00 pm; 1:00 - 4:00 pm

* Tuesday, November 3rd, 10:00 am - 1:00 pm; 1:00 - 4:00 pm

\*We will NOT be knocking on doors and having conversations.\*

We'll meet in a local park to pick up the material and use the PDI app.  Drive your own car and bring a member of your bubble to help out!
