**We're sorry -- this event is full and closed. Please sign up for one of our other upcoming phone bank events soon -- and thank you for your interest!**

Help flip nearby CD-10!  Let's send Democrat Josh Harder  to Washington and turn Congress Blue!  This won't be an easy fight -- Republicans are pouring money into the district to shore up the incumbent.   But Harder is a strong candidate, and we can win this  -- IF we all work together to make it happen!

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

**DATE:** Sunday, Aug 5, 1-4pm

**Location:** Near Cedar & Martin Luther King, Berkeley

**Please RSVP**, and we'll get back to you with more details --  Thank you!
