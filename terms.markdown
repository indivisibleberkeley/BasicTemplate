### Who We Are and What We Do

1. Indivisible Berkeley is a community of volunteers united for the purpose of promoting civic engagement.

2. We encourage people to communicate with elected representatives at all level of government.

3. We provide a forum for people to share information, news, calendar events, and their own opinions because we value free speech, diversity in all its forms, and informed participation among the community at large.

4. We refer people to outside community resources and organizations for other activities.
