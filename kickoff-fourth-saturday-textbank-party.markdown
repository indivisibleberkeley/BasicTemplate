On February 22, we will partner with Flip the West and the Environmental Voter Project (EVP) to text infrequent voters in CO and AZ â€” two key states for victory in November. Our texting will reach environmentally conscious individuals to remind them to vote in their March primaries in order to increase turnout and encourage regular voting habits. For this first 2020 Saturday textbank we would like to prioritize texters who have had some experience with texting. Either way, on-site facilitators will help answer your questions. The texting platform will be Hustle, which is a relatively basic program. If you plan to join us, we will send you training materials in advance.

Please RSVP here by Wed, Feb 19 to let us know if you can make it.
