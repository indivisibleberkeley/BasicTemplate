The Elections Team focuses on flipping red districts through voter contact. We canvass, phonebank, write postcards, and register new voters. We work with and support local partners.

We also work on electoral reform issues.

In 2020, our targets are: CA Congressional District 10, Michigan Coordinated Campaign, Arizona Senate, and Voter Rights. 

We have multiple volunteer asks for each of these! Send an email to elections+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org with your area of interest to learn more.
