### KNOW YOUR RIGHTS

*[Download the Printable Flyer][flyer]*

This is a basic Know Your Rights flier that tells people what to do in the event that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents come to their home. It also provides a number of local agencies and hotlines where free or low cost legal help is available. There are versions of this flier in many other languages, but since it specifically addresses residential raids, we were focusing more on Latinx communities since that's where those residential raids have been occurring. But if you would like the flier in other languages, go to: http://unitedwedream.org/thank-deportation-defense-card-handy-phone/.
