This year, IB volunteers:

* Made 17,593 calls
* Had 835 conversations
* Left 1056 messages to people encouraging voter registration
* Found 531 supporters

Our candidate, Alex Askew, won a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates (by 800 votes). Nancy Guy won her seat to the Virginia House by a very slim margin (18 votes). Cheryl Turpin came close to winning the Senate 7th District seat (losing by 1214 votes).

The Virginia Democrats took control of both houses of the state legislature, ensuring that Democrats will be able to pass progressive legislation and draw fair congressional maps in 2020.

Thank you to everyone who came out to phone bank, text bank, and write postcards during this hard-fought campaign.
