Our phone bankers have made over 32,000 calls so far this year for our targeted campaigns: the Michigan Coordinated Campaign  for Senator Gary Peters and down-ballot candidates; Mission for Arizona and Mark Kelly for Senate; Congressman Josh Harder (CD-10); Joe Biden, and Reclaim our Vote. We've had over 3,500 conversations and found many supporters and local volunteers, helping to build an activist base in the communities we're calling!
