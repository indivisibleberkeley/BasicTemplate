As of early June our phone bankers have made over 18,000 calls for MI Coordinated Campaign, Mission for Arizona and Mark Kelly, Congressman Josh Harder (CD-10), Joe Biden, and Reclaim our Vote. And we've had over 2,000 conversations and found many supporters and local volunteers, helping to build power in those communities!
