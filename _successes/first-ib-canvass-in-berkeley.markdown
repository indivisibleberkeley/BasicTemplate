An intrepid group of IBers hit the streets of Berkeley in January to kick off Neighborhood Knocks, a canvass of Berkeley residents to learn about which local and national issues are at the top of folks' minds. As a bonus, some of the folks we talked to wanted to get involved and signed up to become official members of Indivisible Berkeley!
