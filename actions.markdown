This page lists actions you can take on your own time. Some take a few minutes, some (like calling voters) you should allocate at least 30-60 minutes. We recommend making a habit of taking one action per day or one action per week.

To see our list of group actions, events, and meetings (currently all virtual / remote / online), [check out our "Actions Together" page](/calendar).
