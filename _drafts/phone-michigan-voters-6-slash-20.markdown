Help Flip Michigan Blue!

That’s what we’ll be doing, along with our partners in the East Bay Activist Alliance. We’ll be calling Michigan voters to support candidates for the Michigan State House. The Michigan State House is narrowly Republican-controlled, so we need to protect incumbents in tight districts and flip red seats blue!

VIRTUAL PHONE BANKING: Out of concern for our fellow activists’ health, IB is offering virtual activities only for awhile as we monitor the coronavirus situation. But our work is needed as much as ever, and it’s a lot more fun if we can work together during this difficult period.

We’ll be using Zoom videoconferencing software for this event. We’ll do a quick group training together, and trainers will be available to answer questions. You can also ask for help or comment to the group as you’re making your calls!

Please RSVP as soon as possible so we can email you the log-in information for the event.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: a charged iPad, tablet, or computer; and your cell phone (or landline).
