### Help Flip Michigan Blue!

That’s what we’ll be doing, along with our partners in the East Bay Activist Alliance. We’ll be calling Michigan voters to support candidates for the Michigan State House. The Michigan State House is narrowly Republican-controlled, so we need to protect incumbents in tight districts and flip red seats blue!

VIRTUAL PHONE BANKING: IB is offering virtual phone banks to keep us all safe. Our work is needed as much as ever, and it’s more fun (and motivating) when we  work together during this difficult period.

We’ll be using Zoom videoconferencing software for this event. We’ll do a quick group training, and trainers will be available to answer questions throughout the event.

Please RSVP as soon as possible so we can email you the log-in information for the event.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: an iPad, tablet, or computer; and your cell phone (or landline).
