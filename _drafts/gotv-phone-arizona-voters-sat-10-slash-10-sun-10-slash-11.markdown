**Time to Get Out The Vote time in Arizona! ** **And this time we're doing it differently!**

The Mission for Arizona campaign for Biden, Mark Kelly for Senate, and Dems down the ballot is asking us to join them in their central zoom phone bank,  so we'll hoping you'll join us there!  Campaign staff offer a quick training and support throughout the event on the chat. There are 2 -hour shifts today starting at  10am, 12pm and 2pm.  You can sign up for one or more shifts, or If you're on a roll, you can just stay for an extra shift without repeating the training (unless you want to)! 

**Pick any shift! But If you can, please sign up for these shifts, and maybe we'll all see each other there!  **

**Join us Saturday, 10/17, 12-2pm **
