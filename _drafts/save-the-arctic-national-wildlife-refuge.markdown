### Action
Contact your Senators to support Senate Bill 2461, the Arctic Refuge Protection Act, to designate the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) a protected wilderness area. ANWR is under attack by the Trump administration, which plans to open up the coastal plain to oil exploration and drilling. The Department of the Interior (DOI) is trying to rush this through, with little oversight and inadequate environmental review, and against the wishes of the majority of Americans.  

You can also write, call or email President Trump and Department of the Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, as well as contacting the Bureau of  Land Management Alaska State Office. Let them know that you strongly oppose drilling in ANWR and that this is a priority for YOU.
