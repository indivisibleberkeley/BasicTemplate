**Early voting is on NOW -- help voters in this swing state make their votes count!**

Arizona is a key battleground state– for the presidency and the senate. We need your help to flip red seats blue and re-elect Democrats at every level in Arizona. We’ll be calling voters to help them to vote by mail  ASAP, so they can vote safely and actually have it count! We’ll be calling with the Arizona Democratic Party’s coordinated campaign, “Mission for Arizona,” supporting Senate candidate Mark Kelly and Democratic candidates up and down the ballot. We can flip the white house, U.S. Senate and the Arizona state house if we push hard through election day! Join us!

We’ll be working together on zoom, and we’ll provide training and support throughout the phone bank.

**What you’ll need:** a computer, tablet or ipad, and your phone.

**RSVP as soon as possible**, preferably before the hour preceding our start time or we may miss you! Earlier is better, so that we can send you info you’ll want to read, and can answer questions or offer tech support. by phone before the event.
