**Can't travel or phone voters? You can still be part of GOTV and help flip Virginia! **Help our IB phone banks out! Our phone bankers will be working long hours from October 26-November 5 to Get Out The Vote and flip the Virginia State Legislature. This is the last chance before redistricting this gerrymandered state -- next opportunity is not until 2031! We need: 

**Sign-In Volunteers** to to sign in and orient phone volunteers, direct them to a table, give them printed instructions, and direct them to a trainer if needed. (And keep the hot water going! :)

**Donors & Loaners:** to purchase from our wish list of coffee and supplies, and to loan us a hot pot to keep water warm! 

**Food Volunteers** to bring simple finger foods to these events -- so our phoners stay fed, happy and motivated to keep calling! 

* Please sign up soon so we can plan these big events!
