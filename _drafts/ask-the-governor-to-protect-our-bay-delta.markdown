### Action
Ask Governor Newsom to follow through on his promise to sue the Trump administration to halt implementation of new federal guidelines for the Central Valley Project which would override environmental and endangered species laws by allowing the diversion of more fresh water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Rivers and tributaries.  

The federal administration is poised to implement these guidelines this month. Write or call Governor Newsom and ask him to sue the federal government for the recently issued biological opinions (guidelines) of the Department of Interior and Department of Commerce.
