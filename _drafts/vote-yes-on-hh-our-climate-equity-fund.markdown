For those of you poring over the ballot this weekend, the Science and Environment Team urges you to vote [YES on HH: the Climate Equity Fund](https://berkeleyclimate.org/).

Measure HH would create a Climate Equity Action Fund to increase investment in environmental justice programs, energy efficiency, greener transportation, etc. A small increase in the utility tax on gas and electricity would enable this, while-lower income households would be exempted from the entire tax. Visit [BerkeleyClimate.org](https://berkeleyclimate.org/) for more information. Please [e-mail our very own Mary Ann Furda](maryannfurda@gmail.com) to volunteer by texting voters (super easy and fun to do!) or to get a window sign!

Thanks for your support of climate equity in Berkeley! And please go vote!
