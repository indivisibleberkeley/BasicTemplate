The Mission for Arizona campaign for Biden for POTUS, Mark Kelly for Senate, and all Dems down -ballot is asking all weekend callers to join them in their central zoom phone bank hub.  Centralizing phone banking during GOTV helps campaign staff react quickly to issues that come up, particularly around voter protection.  So we're hoping you'll join us there!  Campaign staff will offer a quick training and support throughout the event on the chat. There are 2 -hour shifts today starting at  10am, 12pm and 2pm.
