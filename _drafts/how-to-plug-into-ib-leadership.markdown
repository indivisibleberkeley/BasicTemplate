The October GA will be a time to discuss self-care and resourcing for the days leading up to and following the November election.

We start promptly at 7:30!

“Doors open” at 7 for socializing and tech troubleshooting. If you have never used Zoom before, we recommend you try connecting at 7 so if there is an issue one of our tech gurus can help you out before the meeting begins.

We will be using the Zoom video conferencing system for this meeting. You can download the software to your computer, laptop, smartphone or tablet by visiting https://zoom.us/download. For very detailed instructions, visit the IB Zoom Tips & Tricks page.
