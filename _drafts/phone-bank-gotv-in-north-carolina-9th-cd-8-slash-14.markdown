Indivisible Berkeley is supporting the Center for Common Ground's Voter Project by calling voters of color to encourage them to vote in North Carolina's special congressional election on September 10.  Early voting starts next week.

Background: Dan McCready, Democrat is running, this time against Republican Dan Bishop.  The district is currently unrepresented due to electoral fraud by the Republican campaign in 2018. 
 
Help us get voters out!
