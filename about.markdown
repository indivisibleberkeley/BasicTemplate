### Indivisible Berkeley endorsement policy

**Our power lies in our numbers, not in our name**


Indivisible Berkeley fulfills its mission through action by collections of individuals,
primarily organized by and through teams.
As an organization, Indivisible Berkeley does not explicitly---whether verbally or in
writing--- endorse candidates, specific policies (e.g. legislation, regulations, initiatives),
groups/coalitions, or events hosted by other groups. Individual participants and teams
also do not use Indivisible Berkeleyâ€™s name---whether visually or verbally---to suggest
that they represent the views of a team or of Indivisible Berkeley as a whole.

Here are some examples for clarification. For the full policy, please read this document: \[[word](/uploads/Endorsements_Policy_FINAL_102917.docx)] \[[PDF](/uploads/Endorsements_Policy_FINAL_102917.pdf)]. If you have questions, please contact your team lead or the Steering Team (at the email address listed on this page).

Do:
 - **Show up for actions that you support**
 - Clarify in public events (e.g. town halls) that you are presenting your individual views 
 - Work with your team to develop and publicize actions
 - Form person-to-person relationships to increase attendance at actions
 - Talk about your *personal* views of a candidate, bill, etc.
 - **Ask the Steering Team** if you're not sure if your plan follows this policy

Don't:
 - Say or imply (e.g. with a t-shirt or sign) that you represent IB when you are speaking in public in a political context (e.g. at a town hall, demonstration not sponsored by IB, or policy hearing)
 - Say or imply that you represent IB at a meeting with policymakers or staff
 - Sign on as an IB team or as IB to specific policies (e.g. petitions, open letters), events not sponsored by IB, or partnerships with other groups
